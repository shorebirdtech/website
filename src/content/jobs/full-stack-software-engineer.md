### The problem

We have one successful product with thousands of monthly users, delivering 10s
of millions of updates around the globe, every month. We built this all with 2
engineers. We also recently launched a second product. We simply need more
engineers to keep up with our growing user base an ambition.

### What You’ll Do

- Build and maintain backend infrastructure (mostly in Dart) that powers
  developer tools used in production apps.

- Contribute to our open source command line tools and native C++ code.

- Own and ship features end-to-end, from our web UI to our backend APIs.

- Help shape our culture, processes, and product direction.

### What We’re Looking For

- Mission alignment. You care about helping the world stop writing everything
  twice. Flutter is our tool for that and Shorebird aims to take Flutter beyond
  where Google can.

- Strong desire to work at a startup. We’re a tiny team. All remote. You’ll have
  to want to make your own decisions and own them.

- You're a strong generalist who can jump into unfamiliar systems and figure
  things out.

- You're a self-starter — you work well with little oversight and thrive in
  ambiguous environments.

- You’re excited about Flutter and want to help it succeed.

- You care about product quality and developer experience.

- You have solid experience with at least one part of the stack — cloud,
  developer tools, or compilers/runtimes — and are eager to learn the rest.

- Bonus: experience with build systems, deployment pipelines, or developer
  tools.

- Bonus: startup experience or contributions to open source projects.

### Why Join

- Work directly with a small, senior team solving hard, high-impact problems.

- Competitive compensation + early equity.

- Shape the future of how mobile apps are built and shipped.
