### Overview

We have one successful product with thousands of monthly users, delivering 10s
of millions of updates around the globe, every month. We built this all with 2
engineers. We also recently launched a second product which is also growing. We
simply need more engineers to keep up with our growing user base and ambition.

### What You'll Do

- Build, ship, and maintain new and current services for Flutter developers and businesses (e.g. crash
  reporting, CI/CD, hosting) from beginning to end.

- Work across our entire software stack. This includes our backends in Dart hosted on Google Cloud, frontends
  in React, and client software in Dart and C++.

- Own and ship features end-to-end, from our web UI to our backend APIs.

- Help shape our culture, processes, and product direction.

- Note: We typically don't use Flutter for our day to day work. We build Flutter itself and services for Flutter.

### What We're Looking For

- Mission alignment. You care about helping the world stop writing everything
  twice. Flutter is our tool for that and Shorebird aims to take Flutter beyond
  where Google can.

- Strong desire to work at a startup. We're a tiny team. All remote. You'll have
  to want to make your own decisions and own them.

- Located in North America (remote).

- 5+ years of experience shipping production (ideally SaaS) applications.

- Experience with public cloud APIs (e.g. GCP, AWS, Cloudflare).

- Experience with Dart or TypeScript.

- Experience with Postgres.

- Nice to have: Experience with C++, Rust or a systems-level language.

- You're a strong generalist who can jump into unfamiliar systems and figure
  things out.

- You're a self-starter â€” you work well with little oversight and thrive in
  ambiguous environments.
- You care about product quality and developer experience.

- Bonus: experience with build systems, deployment pipelines, or developer
  tools.

- Bonus: startup experience or contributions to open source projects.

### Why Join

- Work directly with a small, senior team solving hard, high-impact problems.

- Competitive compensation + early equity.

- Shape the future of how mobile apps are built and shipped.

- You will be joining a very small engineering team with a huge opportunity to work across
  a broad range of tech, collaborate with a senior team, and interface as
  directly as you want with customers around the globe.

- Access to 1000s of customers via our Discord if you need to ask one something.

- We travel 3-4x per year to a central location (e.g. Chicago) to work/socialize
  as a team for a week.
