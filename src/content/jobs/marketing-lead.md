### Overview

Shorebird is building “the Flutter company”. Our founder started/led Flutter,
and now we’re building a company to drive Flutter forward, even if Google
can’t/won’t. We’re starting by filling in the gaps in the Flutter ecosystem,
starting with Code Push (over the air updates). Our first product has been a
success, but only a small fraction of Flutter developers know what we do.

Your job is to help us reach _all_ Flutter developers. We’re so far 3 engineers
and an operations lead. None of us love marketing like you do. You will help us
craft our story and tell it widely. You love talking to developers, you love
writing content, giving talks etc and you’ll have full support to do what it
takes to raise awareness.

### What You’ll Do

- Own marketing. From website content to email campaigns to positioning, you’ll
  shape how we tell the Shorebird story.

- Grow developer awareness. Craft and execute strategies to get Shorebird in
  front of every Flutter developer.

- Grow our social presence. Own and operate Shorebird’s social presence across
  all channels.

- Write and speak. Publish technical blog posts, create videos or live demos,
  speak at conferences, and engage with the community on X, GitHub, Reddit, and
  beyond.

- Advocate for Flutter and Shorebird. Shorebird only succeeds if Flutter does.
  You get to tell both stories to customers at all phases of their adoption
  journey.

- Build relationships. Identify and support influential Flutter developers and
  early adopters.

- Close the loop. Bring insights from the community back to the team to inform
  product direction.

### What We’re Looking For

- Mission alignment. You care about helping the world stop writing everything
  twice. Flutter is our tool for that and Shorebird aims to take Flutter beyond
  where Google can.

- Strong desire to work at a startup. We’re a tiny team. All remote. You’ll be
  the first person fulltime driving awareness and will get to define our
  strategy and approach.

- Scrappy and self-driven. You are the marketing department. You are our DevRel
  org. You’ll have lots of help, but you’ll have to want to make your own
  decisions and own them. You’ll also (likely) be fully remote which means you
  need to be great at self motivation and self-direction.

- Experience working in Product Marketing, Developer Relations, or Technical
  Advocacy — or strong proof you can do the job.

- Strong writing and communication skills. You enjoy breaking down complex
  topics for different audiences.

- Comfort with code. You don’t need to be an expert Flutter dev, but you can
  read docs, run sample apps, and maybe write a working blog demo.

- Bonus: experience in startups, open-source communities, or the Flutter
  ecosystem.

### Why Join

- Work directly with a small, senior team solving hard, high-impact problems.

- Influence product, messaging, and strategy from the ground up.

- Competitive compensation + early equity.

- Shape the future of how mobile apps are built and shipped.

### What will your days look like?

#### First Day

- I've never onboarded as a marketer before, but my guess is we'll spend a lot
  of time together talking about the product, the competition and our goals as a
  company.
- You'll set up your machine (we'll provide whatever setup makes you productive)
  and we'll probably go through our past marketing efforts, social accounts,
  partners, etc.
- You'll join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird) our entire team is on
  there (with 1000s of our customers) all day. Some of us hang out on video
  channels, some just communicate via text, either way we'll be there to make
  sure you're supported.
- Sit down with me (CEO) to hear our story: why we started, who we serve, where
  we're going. You and I will update anything I've missed on our public
  [Handbook](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/).
- We'll do a tour of what marketing we've done so far (site, blog, socials) and
  ask for your first impressions.

#### First Week

- Depending on when you join, we may try to be in person that week, but
  otherwise we'll all get together within the first month or two of your
  joining.
- You'll work with as many of our team as you need to learn our story from as
  many perspectives as you need.
- You'll probably draft up an audit of what's working/not across the marketing
  we've done so far.
- And you'll ship your first few changes to our website, blog, or socials. At
  minimum a "I joined Shorebird" post for a blog, and announce it across our
  socials so we know we've given you all the access you need.

#### First Month

- Build the first version of a marketing plan — a living doc that says, “Here’s
  where we’ll focus and how we’ll measure progress.” The goal of this role is to
  increase awareness (and thus top of funnel). We're here to help, but you're
  our entire "marketing department", so we will lean on your experience to set
  the plans.
- Set up the basic toolkit you need (analytics, mailing list, editorial
  calendar) — we’ll buy or build the things you need.
- Run one end-to-end initiative (a blog series, launch announcement, or
  developer story) and reflect with us on how it landed.

#### First Quarter

- Establish a repeatable rhythm — e.g. blog posts, tweets, newsletter, community
  moments — that feels natural for our size and voice.
- Lead 2–3 higher-impact campaigns (conference presence, product launch support,
  community spotlight) with full founder backing.
- Share insights from early experiments — what messages resonate, what channels
  work — and shape the next quarter’s bets.
- Define the beginnings of Shorebird’s marketing culture: how we tell our story,
  how we show up, and what we’ll need as we grow.
