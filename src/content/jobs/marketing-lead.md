### Overview

Shorebird is building “the Flutter company”. Our founder started/led Flutter,
and now we’re building a company to drive Flutter forward, even if Google
can’t/won’t. We’re starting by filling in the gaps in the Flutter ecosystem,
starting with Code Push (over the air updates). Our first product has been a
success, but only a small fraction of Flutter developers know what we do.

Your job is to help us reach _all_ Flutter developers. We’re so far 3 engineers
and an operations lead. None of us love marketing like you do. You will help us
craft our story and tell it widely. You love talking to developers, you love
writing content, giving talks etc and you’ll have full support to do what it
takes to raise awareness.

### What You’ll Do

- Own marketing. From website content to email campaigns to positioning, you’ll
  shape how we tell the Shorebird story.

- Grow developer awareness. Craft and execute strategies to get Shorebird in
  front of every Flutter developer.

- Grow our social presence. Own and operate Shorebird’s social presence across
  all channels.

- Write, maybe speak. Publish blog posts, possibly create videos or live demos,
  and engage with the community on X, GitHub, Reddit, and beyond.

- Advocate for Shorebird and eventually Flutter. Shorebird only succeeds if
  Flutter does. Our near-term is selling Shorebird products to those already
  using Flutter, but our long-term is selling a story to all developers.

- Build relationships. Identify and support influential Flutter developers and
  early adopters.

- Close the loop. Bring insights from the community and customers back to the
  team to inform product direction.

### What We’re Looking For

- Mission alignment. You care the benefits of being able to deliver high-quality
  products across any screen. Flutter is our tool for that and Shorebird aims to
  take Flutter beyond where Google can.

- Strong desire to work at a startup. We’re a tiny team. All remote. You’ll be
  the first person fulltime driving marketing and awareness and will get to
  define our strategy and approach.

- Scrappy and self-driven. You are the marketing department. You’ll have lots of
  help, but you’ll have to want to make your own decisions and own them. You’ll
  also (likely) be fully remote which means you need to be great at self
  motivation and self-direction.

- Experience working in Product Marketing, Developer Relations, or Technical
  Advocacy — or strong proof you can do the job.

- Strong writing and communication skills. You enjoy breaking down complex
  topics for different audiences.

- Comfort with developers and code. You don’t need to be an expert Flutter dev,
  but you can read docs, ideally run sample code and maybe even write a demo.
  Coding skills are not required, but are welcome. Empathy with and desire to
  market to developers is required.

- Bonus: experience in startups, open-source communities, or the Flutter
  ecosystem.

### Why Join

- Work directly with a small, senior team solving hard, high-impact problems.

- Influence product, messaging, and strategy from the ground up.

- Competitive compensation + early equity.

- Shape the future of how mobile apps are built and shipped.

### What will your days look like?

#### First Day

- We've never onboarded as a marketer before, but my guess is we'll spend a lot
  of time together talking about the product, the competition and our goals as a
  company.
- You'll set up your machine (we'll provide whatever setup makes you productive)
  and we'll probably go through our past marketing efforts, social accounts,
  partners, etc.
- You'll join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird) our entire team is on
  there (with 1000s of our customers) all day. Some of us hang out on video
  channels, some just communicate via text, either way we'll be there to make
  sure you're supported.
- Sit down with me (CEO) to hear our story: why we started, who we serve, where
  we're going. You and I will update anything I've missed on our public
  [Handbook](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/).
- We'll do a tour of what marketing we've done so far (site, blog, socials) and
  ask for your first impressions.

#### First Week

- Depending on when you join, Eric (CEO) might fly out to be in person that week
  (we'll find co-working near you), or we'll time your joining with our
  quarterly team-gathering. Regardless we'll all get together within the first
  month or two of your joining so you can meet the team.
- You'll talk to (video or in person) as many of our team as you need to learn
  our story from as many perspectives as you need.
- You'll draft up thoughts on what's working/not across the marketing we've done
  so far.
- And you'll ship your first few changes to our website, blog, or socials. At
  minimum a "I joined Shorebird" post for a blog, and announce it across our
  socials so we know we've given you all the access you need.

#### First Month

- The goal of this role is to increase awareness (and thus top of funnel). We're
  here to help, but you're our entire "marketing department", so we will lean on
  your experience to set the plans.
- You'll build the first version of a marketing plan — a living doc that says,
  “Here’s where we’ll focus and how we’ll measure progress.”
- We'll probably work on a more formal ideal customer profile (ICP) together.
- We'll make sure you're set up the basic toolkit you need (analytics, mailing
  list, editorial calendar) or we’ll buy or build the things you need.
- You'll run one end-to-end initiative (a blog series, launch announcement,
  developer story, newsletter, etc).

#### First Quarter

- You'll establish a repeatable rhythm — e.g. blog posts, tweets, newsletter,
  community moments.
- You'll design and execute various higher-impact campaigns (conference
  presence, product launch support, community spotlight).
- We'll introduce you to partners across our space and hopefully begin
  collaborations with companies much further invested in their marketing
  efforts.
- You'll help us take marketing insights — what messages resonate, what channels
  work -- back to our product and change what we build to market next.
- You'll lay the beginnings of Shorebird’s marketing culture: how we tell our
  story, how we show up, and what we’ll need as we grow.

We're small, and you're the first marketer. You don't have to have been
officially a "marketer" before (lots of roles could be successful here), but the
primary number you're driving is awareness (probably measured by visits to our
website?). First and foremost you're employee #5 at a small company, which means
you'll wear many hats and your days will vary. You'll learn a lot, and we'll
learn a lot, and hopefully together we'll reach and delight the millions of
Flutter developers who don't yet know their lives could be better with
Shorebird.
