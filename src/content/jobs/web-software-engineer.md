### Overview

We have one successful product with thousands of monthly users, delivering 10s
of millions of updates around the globe, every month. We built this all with 2
engineers. We also recently launched a second product which is also growing. We
simply need more engineers to keep up with our growing user base and ambition.

### What You'll Do

- Own our front-ends. This includes shorebird.dev, console.shorebird.dev,
  admin.shorebird.dev (private), and other projects.

- Implement web-facing features end-to-end. We use small "backends for frontend"
  written in React, talking through to other apis or (in a few cases) our
  Postgres database directly with prisma.

- Help us build all the web/cloud parts for services that Flutter developers
  need, but don't want to build themselves (e.g. anything Firebase offers,
  various GitHub-adjacent services, etc).

- Work with designers to optimize for user experience.

- Help shape our culture, processes, and product direction.

- Note: We do not use Flutter Web (or Jaspr) and don't write raw CSS or HTML.
  UX/UI design skills are welcome (and valued), but you will also have designers
  on contract to support you. Ability to deliver end-to-end features is
  critical.

### What We're Looking For

- Located in North America, ideally Chicago, New York City or San Francisco.

- Strong desire to work at a startup. We're a tiny team. All remote. You'll have
  to want to make your own decisions and own them.

- Mission alignment. You care about helping the world stop writing everything
  twice. Flutter is our tool for that and Shorebird aims to take Flutter beyond
  where Google can.

- 2+ years of experience shipping production web apps.

- At least one year with Remix, React Router, Vue, Next.js, Svelte or similar
  full stack TypeScript framework (we use Remix/React Router).

- Experience with React, TypeScript, Postgres and (ideally) Dart (what our
  backend is written in). You should be able to look at
  https://console.shorebird.dev and say "sure, I could build that".

- Experience testing code and code coverage.

- You're a self-starter â€” you work well with little oversight and thrive in
  ambiguous environments. You'll have support as a member of our engineering
  team, but this still won't be like working at a big tech job with formal
  training or processes, you'll have to learn and teach yourself most things
  (with help).

- You care about product quality and developer experience.

- Nice to have: Experience with Tailwind, ShadCN, Vite, TurboRepo (all of which
  we use).

- Nice to have: Startup experience, ideally B2B SaaS.

### Why Join

- Work directly with a small, senior team solving hard, high-impact problems.

- Competitive compensation + early equity.

- Shape the future of how mobile apps are built and shipped.

- This job is a great opportunity for someone who wants to work at a startup,
  has done some frontend but is generally interested in the opportunities that
  come from working on such a small and senior team.

- Direct access to 1000s of customers via our Discord.

- We travel 3-4x per year to a central location (e.g. Chicago) to work/socialize
  as a team for a week.
