### Overview

We have one successful product with thousands of monthly users, delivering 10s
of millions of updates around the globe, every month. We built this all with 2
engineers. We also recently launched a second product which is also growing. We
simply need more engineers to keep up with our growing user base and ambition.

### What You'll Do

- Own our front-ends (website, console, etc.).

- Work with other engineers to implement the front-end parts of new features and products.

- Contract with designers to optimize for user experience.

- Help shape our culture, processes, and product direction.

- Note: We don't use Flutter, we build Flutter itself and services for Flutter.

### What We're Looking For

- Mission alignment. You care about helping the world stop writing everything
  twice. Flutter is our tool for that and Shorebird aims to take Flutter beyond
  where Google can.

- Strong desire to work at a startup. We're a tiny team. All remote. You'll have
  to want to make your own decisions and own them.

- Located in North America, ideally Chicago, New York City or San Francisco.

- 2+ years of experience shipping production web apps.

- Experience with React, TypeScript, Postgres and (ideally) Dart (what our backend is written in).

- Nice to have: Startup experience, ideally B2B SaaS.

- You're a strong generalist who can jump into unfamiliar systems and figure
  things out.

- You're a self-starter — you work well with little oversight and thrive in
  ambiguous environments.

- You're excited about Flutter and want to help it succeed.

- You care about product quality and developer experience.

- You have solid experience with at least one part of the stack — cloud,
  developer tools, or compilers/runtimes — and are eager to learn the rest.

- Bonus: experience with build systems, deployment pipelines, or developer
  tools.

- Bonus: startup experience or contributions to open source projects.

### Why Join

- Work directly with a small, senior team solving hard, high-impact problems.

- Competitive compensation + early equity.

- Shape the future of how mobile apps are built and shipped.

- This job is a great opportunity for someone who wants to work at a startup, has done some frontend but is generally interested in the opportunities that come from working on such a small and senior team.

- Access to 1000s of customers via our Discord if you need to ask one something.

- We travel 3-4x per year to a central location (e.g. Chicago) to work/socialize as a team for a week.
