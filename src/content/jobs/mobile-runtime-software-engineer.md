### Overview

We have one successful product with thousands of monthly users, delivering 10s
of millions of updates around the globe, every month. We built this all with 2
engineers. We also recently launched a second product which is also growing. We
simply need more engineers to keep up with our growing user base and ambition.

### What You'll Do

- Own all our C++ code, including our Flutter Engine and Dart forks.

- Work with the Google Flutter team to upstream changes from our C++ forks.

- Add new features to our custom Dart and Flutter (e.g. asset push support, Dart
  code obfuscation, port Flutter to new platforms, optimize our interpreter,
  etc.)

- Build out our infrastructure and tooling for maintaining a large code base.

- Write up design documents for a new products or features.

- Work with a customers (and data they've authorized us to use for product
  improvements) to analyze a failure or improve execution with the goal of
  upstreaming changes for the Flutter ecosystem.

- Help shape our company culture, processes, and product direction.

- Note: We don't use Flutter, we build Flutter itself and services for Flutter.

### What We're Looking For

- Mission alignment. You care about helping the world stop writing everything
  twice. Flutter is our tool for that and Shorebird aims to take Flutter beyond
  where Google can.

- Strong desire to work at a startup. We're a tiny team. All remote. You'll have
  to want to make your own decisions and own them.

- Located in North America (remote).

- 5+ years working on shipping software. At least 2+ years with C++.

- Experience with at least one of compilers, runtimes, browsers, game engines,
  or low-level mobile software.

- Nice to have: Experience working on V8, Dart, the Flutter Engine, WebKit, or any other large open source C++ project.

- You're a self-starter â€” you work well with little oversight and thrive in
  ambiguous environments.

- You care about product quality and developer experience.

- Bonus: experience with build systems, deployment pipelines, or developer
  tools.

- Bonus: startup experience or contributions to open source projects.

### Why Join

- Work directly with a small, senior team solving hard, high-impact problems.

- Competitive compensation + early equity.

- Shape the future of how mobile apps are built and shipped.

- You'll do a lot of what Google's Flutter Engine and platform teams do
  (including work on C++ code used by billions every day), however unlike at a
  big tech, you will have direct (financial) incentives to improve outcomes for
  businesses using Flutter and very direct access to those customers and (when
  appropriate authorizations are in place) code, build systems, usage patterns,
  etc, and autonomy and resources to dramatically improve those outcomes.

- This job requires a lot of low-level experience and is much more broad than
  working on similarly specialized systems at a very large company, but has
  incredible rewards of being able to directly affect so many customers so
  quickly (and be thusly compensated through a large ownership stake in the
  company) in ways similar jobs inside big-tech are generally insulated from.

- Access to 1000s of customers via our Discord if you need to ask one something.

- We travel 3-4x per year to a central location (e.g. Chicago) to work/socialize
  as a team for a week.
