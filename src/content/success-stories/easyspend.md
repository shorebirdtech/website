EasySpend is a next-generation fintech company based in Lagos, Nigeria, with a
mission to transform financial transactions for individuals and businesses.
Offering a suite of services including virtual cards, bill payments, and
seamless NGN-USD transactions, EasySpend is solving some of Africa’s biggest
financial challenges. From providing reliable virtual dollar cards for
freelancers and remote workers to enabling businesses with bulk payment
solutions, EasySpend is redefining how people move money.

In creating the mobile applications for EasySpend they turned to Flutter to
ensure that their customer base of over 100,000 active users have a consistent
experience no matter what device they are using. For many Flutter developers,
targeting multiple platforms is a key advantage of the framework. However,
building and deploying iOS apps typically requires access to macOS, creating a
barrier for developers who don’t own a Mac. This was the challenge faced by the
team at EasySpend.

> Being able to deploy to iOS without all of our developers using Mac’s removes
> a significant hurdle for many developers like us

**A Fully Remote Flutter Workflow**

By using services including Shorebird, David Sylvester-Paul, CTO at EasySpend,
and his team have been able to deploy their Flutter application to iOS devices
without all developers on their team owning a Mac. By leveraging Shorebird’s
capabilities alongside other cloud-based tools, they bypassed the traditional
Apple development constraints and successfully shipped their app across all the
platforms that their customers are using.

**Seamless Multi-Platform Deployment**

By spending the engineering effort to integrate Codemagic with Shorebird they
were able to create a mobile CI/CD pipeline that automatically pushes new
builds, delivers patches, and significantly reduces deployment time. With all of
this they have the flexibility to push out app changes on their schedule to
ensure they are hitting their business objectives and customer needs.

> In the past, we often wondered how other highly rated mobile apps updated
> their features without forcing users to manually download an update from the
> store. That curiosity led us to Shorebird, and ever since, we have implemented
> it in all of our applications
>
> - David Sylvester-Paul, CTO at EasySpend

With this approach, EasySpend supports multiple platforms—including iOS and
Android—without over investing in cost prohibitive Apple hardware for an entire
development team. This not only reduces development costs but also empowers more
developers worldwide to build and distribute apps freely.

> Shorebird made the process seamless, allowing me to focus on building great
> apps rather than worrying about hardware limitations.
