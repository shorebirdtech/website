PushPress builds modern, powerful software for gym owners to run their business
and engage with their members. With branded mobile apps, scheduling tools, and
seamless member management, [PushPress](https://www.pushpress.com) helps fitness
professionals focus on what they do best—building strong communities.

PushPress is on a mission to make gym management simpler, and that means
building great software for gym owners and their members. With over 1,500
customers of the
[PushPress Branded App](https://www.pushpress.com/products/branded-member-app)
white-labeled mobile apps, each customized for individual fitness
businesses—PushPress was spending too much time maintaining and updating their
Branded Apps. That all changed when they integrated Shorebird.

## The challenge of scaling white-labeled apps

PushPress provides gym owners with fully branded mobile apps. These apps let
members book classes, make purchases, and engage with their gym community. But
with each app requiring its own assets, configurations, and App Store approvals,
the update process quickly became a bottleneck.

“We were manually clicking through 30 app builds at a time,” said Allan Wright,
Senior Mobile Developer at PushPress. “With over 1,500 Branded Apps, that could
take up to two weeks to finish between all the other work and distractions.”

This pain point became all too real when a bug introduced in a release caused
calendar issues for gym owners—right before a long holiday weekend.

“It ruined the calendar for a specific type of appointment across our apps,”
said Wright. “I couldn’t fix it fast enough. That bug lit the fire to look for
some kind of code push solution to be integrated into our release flow.”

## Fast, reliable updates with Shorebird

PushPress adopted Flutter in 2021 after a tough start with React Native. After
completing the rewrite and getting it released across their customers they
started investing more into the Flutter ecosystem and looking for partners.
After that calendar bug, Shorebird was the next step in modernizing their mobile
infrastructure.

> Our speed to release updates has skyrocketed. It used to take four days to two
> weeks depending on urgency. Now it’s way faster. The reliability of shipping
> fixes is night and day.

With Shorebird, PushPress can patch apps directly—without waiting on app store
reviews or client action.

“Our job is to deliver value regardless of whether a gym owner has time to sign
App Store documents,” said Wright. “With Shorebird, we can do that. Clients are
thrilled they’re still getting new features and fixes without any extra work on
their end.”

## Technical wins and team enthusiasm

Integrating Shorebird across PushPress’ three main apps—including their
“Screens” App, which displays class attendance and gym workout information on a
TV screen through the Amazon Fire Stick—wasn’t without challenges. With a
complex codebase and pipeline already in place, and the need to keep the
business running smoothly, the team needed to ensure zero downtime during the
rollout. While it took some extra work to do that integration, the payoff has
been worth it.

“It’s been really well received,” said Wright. “Especially by the folks who had
to manually roll out those 1,200 apps before. They’re huge fans.”

Today, PushPress is seeing rapid growth in Branded App adoption, with a high
percentage of customers choosing to launch their own white-labeled experience.

“We’ve had a lot of growth in Branded Apps since integrating Shorebird,” said
Wright. “And it’s only going to get better from here.”
