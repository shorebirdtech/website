Junglee Games, a leader in the real money gaming industry, has consistently
delivered engaging experiences to millions of users across the country. With
flagship products like rummy, poker, and fantasy sports apps, they are at the
forefront of the mobile gaming sector. To maintain their competitive edge,
Junglee Games turned to Shorebird to enhance their app deployment and patching
capabilities.

## Moving fast for changing requirements

Facing the challenge of rapid feature deployment and bug fixes, especially
during high-traffic events like the Indian Premier League (IPL), Junglee Games
needed a solution that would allow them to quickly address live issues without
disrupting the user experience. Their existing processes required full app
rollouts, which over time became a blocking issue in their deployment flow.

Full app rollouts require a submission and review from the app stores, which is
not a predictable process, even for small bug fixes. This meant that critical
issues that were affecting users would end up facing launch delays. As a
competitive game, it's a requirement that all users are using the same code, a
level playing field, regardless of the platform or whether their device has
automatically updated their app that day. This made the waiting game with the
review even harder for them to manage.

## Shorebird Integration and Results

Junglee Games discovered Shorebird shortly after its launch and quickly
integrated it into their Android platform. This integration enabled them to
deploy over-the-air patches swiftly, reducing the time to address live issues
from hours or days to mere minutes. The ability to control patch rollouts and
deploy to limited sets of users for internal testing further streamlined their
testing and deployment process.

With Shorebird, Junglee Games achieved remarkable improvements in their
deployment strategy:

- **Rapid Deployment** - During the IPL season, they successfully deployed 18-20
  releases in just 2-3 months, handling a 5x increase in traffic seamlessly.
- **Enhanced User Experience** - The OTA capabilities allowed them to quickly
  fix live issues, ensuring minimal disruption to their vast user base.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization** - By maintaining a single codebase for
  multiple products and leveraging Shorebird’s patching capabilities, Junglee
  Games significantly reduced development time and resource allocation
  especially in the testing and release phase.

Junglee Games’ partnership with Shorebird has been a game changer for their
product, allowing them to maintain their position as a leader in the real money
gaming industry. By embracing Shorebird’s solutions, they continue to deliver
exceptional gaming experiences to their users, setting a benchmark for agility
and efficiency in app deployment.
