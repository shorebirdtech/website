Visible is on a mission to transform the way we understand and manage
energy-limiting conditions like Long Covid and ME (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis).
With over 100 million people around the world living with these illnesses, many
have been left without recognition, support, or the tools they need to navigate
their health. Founded by Harry Leeming, who developed Long Covid following a
mild infection, Visible combines wearable technology and data science to make
the invisible—visible. The platform empowers people living with chronic illness
to measure and manage their symptoms, and contributes to research that can drive
real change in healthcare.

**The Challenge: Rapid Iteration in a High-Need Health Context**

When you’re building technology for people managing chronic illness,
responsiveness matters. The team at Visible moves quickly to learn from users,
improve their product, and ship updates that make a real impact on people’s
daily lives.

But the traditional app store release cycle made it hard to keep up with the
needs of their customers.

> We iterate quite quickly—sometimes with the intention to release weekly or a
> few times a month as we learn from our users. With store releases, we
> sometimes had to wait a few days to get the app to a testing track and then
> another week to get to production.
>
> - Dominik Roszkowski, Lead Engineer at Visible

Beyond new features, quick bug fixes were equally important—especially in a
health context where users depend on the app to track vital information.

> As with every software product, there are bugs. These bug fixes have to go
> through the same approval flow as features which can slow down our response
> time.

**The Solution: Seamless Over-the-Air Updates with Shorebird**

Visible integrated Shorebird into their CI pipeline to streamline their
releases. With Shorebird, the team can push updates—both features and
fixes—directly to users, bypassing the delays of traditional app store
deployments.

“Shorebird was a life changer for us,” said Roszkowski. “Now we can iterate much
quicker. From the developer perspective, it’s really seamless. We created a set
of CI jobs that makes publishing and patching with Shorebird incredibly easy.”

By having Shorebird as a new tool in their development toolbox the Engineering
team at Visible is able to stay ahead of their customers needs. By combining
their analytics that they already track in Mixpanel and Intercom they are able
to react to customer issues in as close to real time as possible and allows them
to see the delivery and adoption of their patches.

> Shorebird helped us tremendously and became a verb in our team—‘let’s
> shorebird it’ is a normal term for us now.

**The Impact: Speed, Reliability, and Empathy-Driven Development**

With Shorebird, Visible can move at the pace of its mission. They’re delivering
updates faster, addressing user needs more responsively, and avoiding the
unnecessary delays around review cycles for simple fixes. That agility is
essential when building tools for a medically under served population—especially
when many team members are also patients themselves.

Visible is more than a health tech startup—it’s a movement. And Shorebird helps
them keep that movement in motion.
