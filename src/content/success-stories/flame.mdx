The [Flame Engine](https://flame-engine.org), is an open source game engine
built for Flutter. It allows Flutter developers to write high quality games that
run on mobile, desktop, and the web. Flame has over
[10,000 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame) and is vital and
widely used project within the Flutter community. With over 29 packages and
heaps of examples, the Flame team had a fairly complex setup for running checks
on pull requests and merges which was manually configured and regularly took
between 7 and 8 minutes to run. The Flame team partnered with Shorebird to pilot
Shorebird CI and improve their continuous integration (CI) setup so that they
could spend less time waiting for checks to run and more time building the best
game engine for Flutter.

## No Configuration, No Problems

With Shorebird's zero configuration CI solution, the Flame team was able to
start using Shorebird's CI with
[less than one minute of setup](https://docs.shorebird.dev/ci). In addition, the
team was able to delete a handful of manual CI configuration and no longer had
to worry about maintaining the workflows, versions of dependencies, etc.

> We just threw out all of our CI config and replaced it with Shorebird CI and
> it both covers all of our needs and does it better than our previous setup,
> without needing any config at all!

## Parallization and Performance Improvements

Shorebird's CI statically analyzes the project and builds a dependency graph in
order to only run checks on affected nodes of the graph. This means that if a
contributor opens a pull request that fixes a bug in `package:flame_3d`,
Shorebird CI will only perform checks against the `flame_3d` package (and its
corresponding example project). Conversely, if a contributor made changes to
`package:flame`, then checks will run against `package:flame` as well as every
package that depends on `package:flame` (either directly or transitively).

In addition, Shorebird CI automatically runs checks for each node in the
dependency graph in parallel which led to a significant decrease in the average
time taken to perform CI checks. Before Shorebird, the Flame CI checks would
always exercise all tests (among other checks) regardless of what changed in a
pull request. This meant that their CI checks would regularly take between 7 and
8 minutes. By parallelizing and only running checks for affected nodes,
Shorebird was able to cut that time down by over 50% across the board and in
some cases Shorebird CI reduced check times by as much as 95%. For the same set
of code changes, checks that would previous take 7-8 minutes to run, now run in
approximately 3 minutes. When a pull request does not contain code changes,
Shorebird CI checks complete in approximately 20 seconds.

## Key Takeaways

Shorebird CI was able to both provide significant speed ups in CI checks while
also reducing the complexity of maintaining CI workflows for a large monorepo.
We're very honored to have been able to work with the Flame team as they are a
vital project within the Flutter ecosystem and we love any opportunities to give
back to the open source Flutter & Dart communities ðŸ’™
