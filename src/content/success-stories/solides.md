At Solides, speed matters. As one of Brazil’s leading HR tech companies, Solides
empowers businesses to manage their people more intelligently, with behavioral
profiling, performance evaluations, HR analytics, time tracking, and vacation
management solutions. Their mobile apps sit at the center of this strategy,
connecting employees, managers, and HR teams with powerful tools that make work
better.

But as Solides grew, so did the pressure on their mobile release process. With
hundreds of thousands of users relying on their flagship Solides App — a
comprehensive “super app” for feedback, evaluations, and goal tracking — the
traditional pace of app store reviews simply couldn’t keep up. Critical hot
fixes could take days, sometimes even weeks, to reach users. In the fast-moving
world of HR, that kind of delay wasn’t just inconvenient — it risked damaging
user trust.

“We were growing quickly, but the app release control over app stores was
becoming slower and more complex,” said Solides’ Engineering Coordinator Pedro
Afonso Ramos de Souza. “We needed a faster, more reliable way to deliver
critical updates without being tied to store review timelines.”

That search led them to Shorebird.

## Finding a Faster Path Forward

Two years ago, the Solides team discovered Shorebird’s Code Push solution. They
started cautiously, rolling out Shorebird to one of their secondary apps. It
didn’t take long to see the difference.

With Shorebird, Solides could deliver bug fixes and urgent updates in minutes or
hours instead of waiting days. Confident in the results, they expanded Shorebird
into their main Solides app, reaching over half a million users across Brazil.

> Shorebird has been a game changer for us. We can now push critical updates
> almost instantly. The experience for our users improved dramatically, and our
> engineering team feels much more confident releasing new features.

## Turning Crisis into Confidence

The real test came during a critical bug incident. Traditionally, resolving such
an issue would have meant weeks of frustration for both the team and their
users. With Shorebird, Solides was able to deploy three patches within two days,
protecting user experience and preserving client trust — all while keeping
development costs low.

Today, Shorebird has become an essential part of Solides’ mobile strategy. They
primarily use it to deliver bug fixes and minor updates — but they’re already
working internally to expand its use even further, integrating Shorebird deeper
into their full release cycle.

> Our goal is to make Shorebird part of everything we do on mobile. It’s proven
> itself. It’s helping us move faster, serve users better, and innovate with
> confidence.

In the fast-paced world of HR tech, staying ahead requires more than just great
ideas — it demands the ability to deliver them, instantly. Thanks to Shorebird,
Solides is doing exactly that.
