We’re excited to roll out Yearly Plans for Shorebird. These plans are designed
to give you more flexibility and predictability as you build and scale your
apps.

## Why Yearly Plans?

As our customer base has grown, so has the demand for yearly plans. Based on
your feedback, the need typically comes down to two main reasons:

1. **Purchasing Process** - We’ve heard from many of you that yearly plans are
   essential to your internal purchasing processes—whether you’re part of a
   large organization with budget cycles or a small team looking to simplify
   payments. Some teams need yearly invoicing for budgeting, while others just
   want the convenience of avoiding monthly billing fluctuations.
2. **Unable to Predict Monthly Volume** - When starting with a new service, it’s
   tough to know how your team will use it until you dive in and experiment.
   We’ve seen usage spikes when business-critical issues arise are the moments
   when fast patches matter most but weren’t accounted for in the monthly
   budget. Whether you’re launching a new feature, onboarding users, or running
   a seasonal campaign, monthly patch usage can vary wildly. Picking the “right”
   monthly plan can become a headache.

With our new yearly option, these issues are a thing of the past.

## How It Works

- **One payment. 12 months of Shorebird.** Pay once upfront and get a full year
  of access to Shorebird. No more chasing monthly invoices or wrangling with
  payment systems.
- **Patches credited upfront.** You’ll receive your entire year’s worth of
  patches on day one. Use them when you need them—whether you’re shipping daily
  or ramping up after a big launch. You can go beyond our typical monthly
  limits, as long as you stay within your new annual total. That means freedom
  to move fast when it matters most.
- **No overages, no surprises** With our yearly plans, what you pay upfront is
  it. No surprise charges. This means you can scale your patch usage during busy
  times and slow down during quieter periods all without worrying about trigging
  unexpected fees.

## Who’s This For?

Anyone can sign up for Yearly Plans as its available starting today via our
Shorebird Console. Not sure if it’s right for you? Here are some use cases that
inspired this update:
