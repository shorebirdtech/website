I’m excited to share that I’ve joined Shorebird!

For me, this decision wasn’t just about the next step in my career. It was about doubling down on Flutter and multi-platform development.

## A Longstanding Passion for Flutter

I’ve been involved in the Flutter community since 2019, starting during my time at BMW and later at Very Good Ventures. Over the years, I’ve seen Flutter grow from an ambitious new framework to a powerhouse for multi-platform development. I’ve worked with teams around the world pushing Flutter to its limits, helping scale production apps, and advocating for its potential to simplify and accelerate development across mobile, web, and desktop.

Through it all, my belief has only strengthened: multi-platform should be the standard for application development. Businesses and developers shouldn’t have to choose between performance, maintainability, and reach. Flutter has already proven that a single codebase can deliver beautiful, native experiences across platforms, and Shorebird is building the tools to push that even further.

## Why Shorebird?

Right now, Shorebird is tackling one of the biggest pain points in mobile development—getting updates to users faster. With code push, developers can fix bugs and ship improvements instantly, without waiting for app store approvals. This alone is a game-changer, but it’s just the beginning of what Shorebird is building.

When the opportunity came to join a team focused on solving real-world developer challenges in the Flutter ecosystem, I knew I had to be part of it.

## Staying in the Flutter Ecosystem

The Flutter community has been an incredible place to be, and I wanted to stay in this space because I truly believe in its potential. Multi-platform development isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s the best way to build apps. I’ve seen firsthand how Flutter enables teams to move faster, deliver high-quality experiences, and reach more users with less overhead.

At Shorebird, I’ll focus on helping the company grow beyond engineering, encompassing product, sales, marketing, and operations, to provide these tools to as many Flutter developers as possible. The Shorebird team already includes some of the best minds in Flutter, and I’m excited to contribute to their vision.

## What’s Next?

If you’re a Flutter developer, I’d love to connect and hear your thoughts on what you need to ship better apps, faster. Shorebird is just getting started, and there’s a lot of exciting work ahead.

Let’s build the future of multi-platform development—together.
