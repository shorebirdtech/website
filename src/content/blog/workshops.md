We're exited to announce the team at Shorebird will be hosting free 1 hour long
online workshops for getting started with Shorebird.

You can register now at https://shorebird.dev/workshops

Our first workshop of the year will be on **Monday January 13th at 7:30pm CST**
but we hope to have more dates in the future.

In order to provide a high quality experience, we've limited the number of
available spots so be sure to sign up as soon as possible to ensure a spot.

In these workshops weâ€™ll walk through all the steps needed to get Shorebird
working on a Flutter app of your choice. Either follow along with a provided
Flutter app or bring your own app.

Along the way weâ€™ll look at how to manage apps, releases, patches, and more
using the Shorebird CLI and Console. We will also cover how to use
`package:shorebird_code_push` to customize the user experience.

By the end of the workshop, you should have Shorebirdâ€™s code push solution
integrated into a Flutter app and have a solid understanding of how to deliver
over the air updates to your users.

We look forward to seeing you there ðŸ‘‹
