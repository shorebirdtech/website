I founded the Flutter project 10 years ago, and led the Flutter team at Google
for 8 years. I'm reasonably well known in the Flutter community and receive a
lot of email from both job-seekers and job-posters regarding Flutter.

I've also been a manager for a decade and can tell you, hiring is hardâ€”from
both sides. It's hard for companies to find candidates, and it's hard for
candidates to find companies.

This can be made extra-hard when trying to search for a subset of jobs which
include a specific technology choice, like Flutter.

I generally try to dissuade both job-seekers and job-posters to search
specifically for Flutter, under the belief that Flutter is a tool -- a means to
an end -- and like other tools will come and go in popularity over time and what
we all (ideally) focus on in our jobs is solving customer problems. As
technologists, we learn whatever tools we need to do accomplish that
goal including Flutter.

The difference is subtle, but I believe important. Most places that should be
using Flutter may not know they should be using Flutter (because they haven't
hired the person to make that choice yet). Similarly, many developers who will be
successful with Flutter may not be using it yet, because they're using whatever
technology is required by their current role to solve current problems.

That said, people understandably search for and advertise for "flutter jobs"
and so here are some tips I give to be successful with such.

### A as a Job Seeker

Two tips:

1. As per my rant above, I'd recommend searching for "mobile jobs" or something
   broader than "flutter" for most searches. Flutter provides so many advantages
   over traditional mobile development, but the recruiter isn't a technology
   expert, you are. The business likely knows "we need an iOS app", but might
   not realize "we need a Flutter app". There are lots of jobs looking for your
   skills who don't know how to hire you. As the technologist, YOU will be
   making (or at least influencing) the decisions as to what tech stack to use.

2. Consider small companies first. The larger macro-economy changes over time,
   but at time of writing (October 2024), I see a _lot_ of activity and hiring
   for small companies, and only a beginning of a resurgence in hiring for
   larger ones. I'm not an economist, but that's my sense.

#### Startups

- https://workatastartup.com/ -- Y-Combinator's Startup Job board.
- Every large venture capital firm (VC) has a job board for their portfolio
  companies. You can simply Google "top 10 VCs" or "top 10 VCs in Europe" (or
  whatever your region) and find VCs and through that find startup jobs, e.g.
  https://jobs.accel.com/jobs https://jobs.sequoiacap.com/jobs
  https://jobs.a16z.com/jobs are all VCs near where I live, but there are 100s
  more like this.

#### Consulting

There are 10s (if not 100s?) of Flutter-specialized consultancies. This is
typical for a new technology, that often "outside expertise" is hired before
hiring might be done in-house. If you like having a variety of app work, Google
keeps a list of good consultancies:

- https://flutter.dev/consultants I've personally worked with:
- https://verygood.ventures
- https://gskinner.com/ And can attest to them being excellent.

#### General

- https://hnhiring.com/ -- A site which aggregates "Who's hiring" posts from
  Hacker News.
- https://job.zip/jobs/flutter -- Someone's small job searching startup, but
  also the best technology-based jobs aggregator I've found.
- LinkedIn. I've not found a lot of success personally on LinkedIn, but there is
  a lot of volume there.
- Twitter. I (https://x.com/@_eseidel) post about jobs involving Flutter when
  people send them to me. Others do too.

#### Recruiters

There are increasingly Flutter-specific recruiters. I don't know any off-hand
(you're welcome to email me at eric@shorebird.dev if you are one), but I've met
one or two at Flutter conferences, so I know it's a thing. Finding a
Flutter-specific recruiter might help you find some jobs you might have
otherwise missed. Recruiters are literally _paid_ to find you (they get paid a
percentage of your first year of salary as a finders fee), so they are typically
very happy to know you exist.

#### Portfolios

Yes, you need a place for someone to see what you've built.

No, it doesn't need to be a fancy portfolio. (But that doesn't hurt.)

It's just like a resume (or a website for some business). People want to be able
to understand that you've successfully done stuff before (implying you are
likely to do stuff for them too if hired), and they want to be able to browse
through such on their own (e.g. a resume, portfolio site, GitHub, etc.)

I would encourage focusing one's efforts on _doing things_ and letting them be
publicly visible if possible, rather than making the presentation of such
amazing. Substance over form (unless you're applying for a job like Design
Engineer, where someone cares deeply about your design presentation).

#### A note on networking.

As mentioned, hiring is hard. There are so many factors, including importantly
_awareness_ and _risk_. A company needs to know you exist (find you somehow) and
be convinced that you are a low-risk hire. Two of the ways to help with such is
simply old-fashioned networking. Meeting people, and talking to people you
already know about your problems/questions, in this case job seeking. Knowing
someone, or having them be a friend-of-a-friend, eliminates both the factors of
awareness and risk, so work your network as much as you can. When I'm hiring (or
trying to be hired), I literally keep a spreadsheet of all the people I know and
when I last talked to them, etc. You don't have to go that far, but working your
network will help.

#### Cold Outreach

Cold outreach can work, but generally is pretty low-chance. When it's high
chance is when you have something that the person on the other end of the email
wants. As someone who knows Flutter, your probably _do_ have something they
want, you just may need to explain it to them in ways they understand. One way
to do that is to present to them about how you can help them solve business
problems with your skills.

As an example, Flutter is still a "new" technology. There are many companies
that _could_ sell services into the Flutter ecosystem (millions of devs!) but
don't yet. A (still low-percentage) tact could be to reach out to one of these
and pitch working on Flutter support for their product. Most of these companies
are easily reachable on Twitter and LinkedIn, and even if they don't have an
opening can be useful. _If_ I were to engage in such I would probably do so
focused on my own personal learnings (e.g. I want to learn the Stripe API so
I'll build a demo of a great Stripe package) to maximize my own upside
potential.

### As a Job Poster

In terms of posting jobs, my suggestions are similar to the above:

1. Mention Flutter. A lot of devs _want_ to work with Flutter, if you want to
   hire Flutter-aware devs or are at least considering Flutter as a possible
   technology, mention it.
2. Get your job on the web. A publicly-accessible URL is key (and may be
   legally required for some jobs), if you have that (and not buried behind
   sign-in, etc.) others can share it.
3. Get your network to share it! LinkedIn is great, but there are millions of
   Flutter devs, and most are not on LinkedIn. https://flutter.dev/community
   lists some Slack channels and Discord channels. You can also simply tweet at
   me (or tag me on LinkedIn) and I'm happy to share your job wider.
4. If you can, hire remote. There are so many amazing Flutter Devs all over the
   world. Many of them are very capable adults who work well remotely.

If I've missed something, let me know.

Good luck all.

Eric
