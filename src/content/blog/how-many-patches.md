One of the most common questions we hear from teams considering Shorebird is:

> How many patches will I need?

It‚Äôs a fair question and one we designed our pricing model to make easy to
answer.

Our pricing is simple: a flat monthly rate based on the number of patch installs
you think you need. That‚Äôs it.

You can:

- Push as many releases and patches to the Shorebird system as you want
- Set up staging, internal, or testing tracks
- Generate patches for every commit

All without triggering any billable usage.

You‚Äôre usage is only tracked when a patch is actually installed on a user‚Äôs
device. That means you can build Shorebird into your workflow without worrying
about surprises or hidden fees.

## A Simple Starting Point

If you‚Äôre unsure what plan is right for you, here‚Äôs a helpful rule of thumb:

> Take your monthly active users (MAU) and double it.

This gives you the freedom to send two patches per month to your entire user
base, with a buffer to grow. Most teams find that more than enough to stay fast
and flexible without ever worrying about hitting limits.

## Built for All Kinds of Teams

We‚Äôve designed our plans to work for teams on both ends of the spectrum.

üõ° **The Safety Net Approach**

Some teams treat Shorebird as a form of ‚Äúproduction insurance.‚Äù They push a
minimal number of patches a month, using our platform when something breaks or
slips through QA. For these teams, the value is peace of mind. Knowing that if
something does go wrong, they can fix it instantly without waiting on App Store
or Play Store review.

‚ö° **The Iteration Powerhouse**

Other teams build patches into their daily workflow. They generate a patch every
time a new commit hits main, push it to a staging track, and test in
production-like environments. If things look good? Push it live. If not? Roll it
back instantly. For these teams, Shorebird is a critical part of how they move
fast and deploy with confidence.

Both are valid. Both are supported.

## You‚Äôre In Control

Whether you send one patch a year or dozens a month, our pricing is designed to
scale with your needs. You‚Äôre not locked into a fixed model, and you can upgrade
or adjust as your usage evolves.

So take a breath. You don‚Äôt need to overthink it.

Start by doubling your MAU and see how it goes. You‚Äôll likely find that
Shorebird gives you more flexibility and fewer headaches than you expected.
