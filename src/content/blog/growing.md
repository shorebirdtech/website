<!-- cspell:words janky -->

11 years ago, a group of us left the Chrome team believing there had to be
something better than janky web pages, or complicated Java apps to build for
mobile, and began
[the journey that would yield Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqGAC5QCYuQ).
I would come to lead to lead and grow the Flutter (and eventually Dart) teams at
Google until leaving in 2022 to start Shorebird. I left Google in part because I
realized there were problems I wanted to solve for Flutter that couldn't be
solved within Google and felt that in the long-term Flutter would be best served
by a company wholly focused on Flutter. I set out to build that company.

Flutter over those 11 years has thrived. It saw early public success with the
Hamilton App, NuBank, Toyota, Tencent, Alibaba, ByteDance, and Google's wide
deployments across Assistant, GPay, Classroom, Earth, etc. Flutter now accounts
for
[almost a 3rd of all free app submissions on iOS](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/celebrating-flutters-production-era/)
and is used around the globe by millions of developers and businesses of
[all shapes and sizes](https://flutter.dev/showcase).

Shorebird, has also found its place in this success. We started with Code Push,
to address the
[#1 most up-voted issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14330) on
Flutter, and are now serving thousands of businesses globally each month,
helping them update their apps for millions of customers. But there is so much
more to do, and so much more we can do, to further Flutter and I still believe a
focused home for Flutter is what lies in our future.

Shorebird's revenues have tripled since the start of this year, and our userbase
has grown similarly. So much so that our tiny team now struggles to keep up with
it all. We're even about to launch a
[second product](https://ci.shorebird.dev/), which surely will stretch our team
thinner. It's time for Shorebird to grow. We're well funded from a top-5 VC and
excellent angel investors and on a path to cross into profitability early next
year. But we're still small enough (only 4 of us!) that there is vast amounts of
opportunity available to anyone joining us to chart the future of Shorebird and
Flutter.

We're hiring for a range of engineering roles, including a web-specialist
(including potentially early-career candidates), a senior full-stack/generalist
and a senior C++ specialist (to own our custom compiler and runtime). We're also
hiring someone to lead our marketing efforts and teach this group of engineers
how to the millions of Flutter developers who haven't even heart of us yet.
We're fully remote, able to hire anywhere in North America with existing team
members near San Francisco, Chicago and New York City. We're a senior team, all
well-functioning adults who know how to get stuff done. We pay well (including a
large equity stake), with good benefits and are looking for great folks like
yourself to join us.

Come work with us and build the future of development!
