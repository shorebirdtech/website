Our customers have been asking for an opinionated development workflow
which integrates Shorebird so that they can spend more time shipping and less
time defining and building a release/patch pipeline that integrates Shorebird.

We're excited to announce that we've put together a [development
workflow guide](https://docs.shorebird.dev/guides/development-workflow) which
includes:

- 🪵 Branching and tagging strategy
- ✅ Automated continuous integration checks
- 🚀 Automated releases for iOS and Android
- 🧩 Automated patches for iOS and Android
- 👀 Staged patches that are ready to promote to production with 1 click
- 🐙 Ready to use GitHub Workflows
- 💙 An open source example application for reference

If you have any questions or feedback, reach out to us on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird) -- we'd love to help!
