It‚Äôs been a year full of in person conferences and meetups for us and we are
just getting started. It‚Äôs amazing to be able to get out into the community and
see how Shorebird is being used but also hearing feedback from current and
prospective customers. It seems like once developers realize the tools that
Shorebird adds to their Flutter toolbox they can‚Äôt help but want to get it
integrated into their current project.

So with that knowledge we‚Äôre setting sights on the largest Flutter conference in
North America. Shorebird is proud to sponsor
[Fluttercon USA 2025](https://www.flutterconusa.dev) taking place June 25‚Äì26 in
New York City!

As strong supporters of the Flutter community, we‚Äôre thrilled to join hundreds
of developers, teams, and product leaders to talk about building, scaling, and
shipping faster with Flutter. At Fluttercon USA you will be able to learn from
industry experts, attend diverse sessions, engage with a vibrant community of
developers, and more. It‚Äôs also co-located with Droidcon NYC so you can expand
your learning and networking horizons. And new this year,
[the techlead summit](https://www.techlead-summit.com). This track is designed
for Principal Engineers, Senior Developers & Managers to be able to talk about
scaling teams, fostering culture and how to drive impact from the team
management side of things.

trigger just yet we have something for you.
