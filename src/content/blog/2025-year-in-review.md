2025 was a year of transformation for Shorebird. We grew our team, launched new
products, and supported thousands of customers around the globe. We not only
expanded our offerings but also deepened our commitment to supporting developers
and businesses in the Flutter and Dart ecosystems. Here are just some of the
highlights for the year.

## **Doubled our products and our team**

In September we introduced
[Shorebird CI](https://shorebird.dev/blog/introducing-shorebird-ci/), our second
product tailored for Flutter and Dart developers. Shorebird CI streamlines the
continuous integration process with our zero-config setup, making it easier than
ever to build, test, and deploy Flutter applications. Our goal was to provide a
powerful yet user-friendly tool that fits seamlessly into your workflow.

Since the beta launched we’ve been actively listening to customers and
continuously incorporating their feedback into the product as we keep building
towards a full production release.

By the end of the year we will have also doubled the size of our team from three
to six, adding a
[head of operations](https://shorebird.dev/blog/tom-joins-shorebird/), a
[head of marketing,](https://shorebird.dev/blog/why-dawn-joined) and another
engineer will be joining before the year comes to a close.

Check out our [open positions](https://shorebird.dev/jobs/) if you’re interested
in joining us.

## **Community-first mindset**

This year, we've traversed the conference circuit, soaking up knowledge and
spreading the Shorebird love. One of our favorite moments was our keynote at
[FlutterCon EU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aphP_Hc7KiI&list=PLdxnFp69P7nqnOjY1rPIPuQJT9rH3Wc9p&index=3&pp=iAQB).

We were proud to sponsor a number of global events and support customers sharing
their stories on stage.

- At FlutterCon USA Tom shared his journey with Flutter and Shorebird in a quick
  [15-minute interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcvVqNa78s0&list=PLdxnFp69P7nqnOjY1rPIPuQJT9rH3Wc9p&index=5)
- Not only did Eric take the stage at FlutterCon EU, but
  [Umit Duran shared how Wolt integrated Shorebird into their architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85LltPMtLas&list=PLdxnFp69P7nqnOjY1rPIPuQJT9rH3Wc9p&index=1).
- During FlutterBytes in Nigeria, [Idris Idris](https://x.com/IdrisAdeyemiId1)
  gave a talk on “Hot-Restart in Production: An Introduction to Shorebird.

It’s great to engage with the community, share knowledge and connect. We’re
looking forward to hitting the conference circuit in 2026\.

## **Accelerating Customer Growth**

Our reach extends far beyond the U.S., encompassing startups and large
enterprises globally. We had an influx of new customers this year, over 16,000
new users signed up for Shorebird. That's a whole lot of new developers who are
eager to join our community and experience the magic of our platform. And we
doubled the number of paid subscribers over last year. Our global customers
deployed hundreds of millions patches to their end users on Android ,iOS, Mac,
Windows, & Linux saving countless hours of developer time.

Ensuring customer satisfaction is our top priority. The fact that thousands of
developers keep coming back and singing our praises? That’s the real MVP.

## **Customer Showcase**

This year we started amplifying the voices of and successes of Shorebird
customers. From gaming to finance, customers across the globe shared their
stories with us. One thing all these stories have in common is how Shorebird can
help organizations increase customer satisfaction when their apps can be updated
instantly. From simple bug fixes to large feature rollouts, we’ve been able to
help companies of all sizes ensure they can keep their business priorities top
of mind, instead of having to play the coordination game with store reviews.

Can you imagine having to roll-out and wait for store approvals for over 1,200
apps? That’s what the team at
[PushPress](https://shorebird.dev/success-stories/push-press/) experienced when
they had to update their branded mobile apps and scheduling tools. Shorebird
helped them save over 1,000 days of release management time.

In fast-paced markets, like crypto and blockchain every minute counts, waiting
days to release features is a non-starter.
[WAGUS](https://shorebird.dev/success-stories/wagus/) introduced Code Push to
deliver small quality-of-life updates to users the same day.

Collaborating with a diverse array of customers who have achieved remarkable
outcomes has been a delight and in 2026 we are expanding our customer programs.

## Here’s to 2026

We’ve got a lot in store for 2026. From launching new features and enhancements
for Code Push, to the general availability release of Shorebird CI, and maybe
announcing our third product. But before we dive into 2026 we’ll be taking some
time to rest and recharge. Wishing you all a happy holiday season.
