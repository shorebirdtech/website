Starting a new Flutter project? We just made that a whole lot easier.

Today we’re excited to announce a new addition to the Shorebird CLI: the
`shorebird create` command.

This new command helps you spin up production-ready Flutter apps with one simple
line. If you want to take a look under the hood on how this works then jump over
to our [docs to find out more](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/create/).

No more forgetting to configure your project. No more context switching. No more
setup steps later on.

Just:

```bash
shorebird create my_next_flutter_app
```

and you’re ready to build, iterate, and ship fast—with the power of Shorebird
baked in from day one.

## Why this matters

We’ve seen countless teams start building only to add Shorebird later, often
while rushing to fix a bug or prepare for a big launch. With shorebird create,
your CI/CD, over-the-air updates, and release tooling are part of the
foundation, not an afterthought.

It’s our latest step toward making Flutter development more powerful and more
delightful.

## Try it today

To get started:

1. Make sure you have the latest Shorebird CLI

```bash
shorebird upgrade
```

2. Then run:

```bash
shorebird create my_next_flutter_app
```

That’s it. You’re setup and ready to build.

## What's next?

Over time we hope to add more customization to this create command to ensure
that anyone starting a new project has a great place to kick off from without
having to worry about all the boilerplate that comes with a new project. But if
there are specific things that your looking for in this command don't hesitate
to reach out with your ideas. Just jump into our
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/shorebird) or drop us an email at
[contact@shorebird.dev](mailto:contact@shorebird.dev) with your request.
