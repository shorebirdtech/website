_Shorebird Code Push allows developers to deploy fixes to Flutter apps
instantly, over the air, to end usersâ€™ devices. It takes less than 5 minutes to
integrate and requires no changes to your code or dev workflows. Updating
through Shorebird can change any amount of Dart code in your app and is designed
to help you fix your app quickly and safely, while still complying with Apple
and Google store policies._

Shorebird Pro subscribers have long enjoyed per-app collaboration, where they
were able to share a single app with multiple other developers. However until
today it was not possible to share groups of apps to groups of people all at once. Nor was it
possible to set up sharing without having apps in the first place. To address
both of these, we've introduced "Organizations" support in Shorebird.

Your team can now collaborate on a group of apps together, and control access
to that group of apps in a single place. It's also now possible to have the
person who sets up billing and access for an organization be separate from the
person who creates the apps.
