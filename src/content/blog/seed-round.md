We at Shorebird, a developer tools company founded by the creators of Flutter, have
raised a $3M seed round led by [Accel](https://www.accel.com), with
participation from leading founders and operators across the ecosystem.
Investors include Yuri Sagalov (AeroFS), Linus Upson (former Flutter VP), Neha
Narkhede (Confluent), Jessica McKellar (Pilot.co), Andrew Lee (Firebase), Chris
McKillop (former Flutter Manager), Miguel de Icaza (Xamarin), Paul Copplestone
(Supabase), and Andrew Miklas (PagerDuty).

Shorebird helps businesses succeed with Flutter. We started this journey
by solving one of the biggest pain points in mobile development: slow release
cycles. Our first product, Code Push, enables developers to deliver instant
over-the-air updates to Flutter apps across iOS, Android, and Desktop Systems,
bypassing traditional app store review bottlenecks. Already, millions of users
receive updates powered by Shorebird every day.

## Expanding Products and People

With this round, Shorebird has been able to accelerate product development,
start its team, and expand its platform beyond Code Push. Most recently, the
company launched their second product
[Shorebird CI](/blog/introducing-shorebird-ci), a zero-config continuous
integration system built exclusively for Flutter and Dart. They are now
[hiring for a few new roles](/jobs), and are excited to bring more talented
people into the team to help build faster, support more customers, and invest
even more in the Flutter ecosystem.

“Mobile development has always lagged behind the web when it comes to speed of
iteration,” said Eric Seidel, CEO of Shorebird and creator of Flutter.
“Shorebird is here to change that. With Code Push and now Shorebird CI, we’re
making Flutter development faster, more reliable, and better aligned with how
modern teams build software.”

“We’re excited to back Shorebird at this very early stage,” said
[Dan Levine, Partner at Accel](https://www.accel.com/people/daniel-levine#bay-area).
“Eric and the team bring unmatched expertise as the original builders of
Flutter. Shorebird is solving a critical challenge for millions of developers
and companies, and the early traction they have proves this is a
category-defining opportunity.”
