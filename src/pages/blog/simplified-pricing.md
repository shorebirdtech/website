# Simplified Flexible Pricing

Today we’re announcing simplified pricing for Shorebird.  We offer two plans: Free and Pro.

Free
Includes 5,000 patch installs per month
Unlimited Apps.  1 User

Pro
$20 per month
Includes 50,000 patch installs per month
Additional installs at $0.0004 per install, with configurable spending limit.
Unlimited Apps.  Unlimited Collaborators.

Previously, Shorebird offered a variety of usage tiers.  Customers told us this
was confusing and harder to manage for apps with variable updating needs.  So
we’ve moved to a single, simpler paid plan to answer this need.

With Pro, your only commitment is to the $20 monthly platform fee, which
includes 50,000 patches delivered.  Use as much or as little beyond that as you
want, and only get billed for what you use.

Customers can control their spending limit from within console.shorebird.dev.
Your spending limit defaults to $0 and our infrastructure will automatically
notify you via email once when you’re close to your limit and again when you’ve
reached your limit.

Existing Shorebird customers with “Hobby” or “Teams” will see no changes. You
can keep your plan as you like, or you’re welcome to transition to this new
usage-based billing at any time via the console.shorebird.dev.

We made a bunch of improvements behind the scenes to make this happen. If you
have any questions about billing, or would like to purchase Shorebird in a
different way, please don’t hesitate to reach out.  contact@shorebird.dev.
