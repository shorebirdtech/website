# Work at Shorebird

## About Shorebird

The problem: Today, businesses write the same app at least twice at 2x the
necessary costs, with redundant code-bases, teams, bug lists. Flutter has proven
that high-quality multi-platform is possible. However, adopting Flutter can be
challenging since the default offerings from Google are sometimes an ill fit or
incomplete for non-Google teams. Shorebird is filling in the gaps business need
to be successful with Flutter development, starting with code push.

We're here to save developers and business time and money, help them provide
their customers with better experiences, and hopefully make the world a better
place.

The primary unlock we made in building Flutter was bringing circa 2014 web tech
to mobile (reactive programming, hot reload, etc). Shorebird is repeating this
by bringing 2023 web tech to mobile (blurring client/server, always up-to-date
deploys, etc).

We're a default-public organization, we operate on a [public
discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird), our
[source](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/) and
[planning](https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects) are public. We're an
all remote, distributed team.

More information about the company we're trying to build can be found in our
[public handbook](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook)

## Founding Compiler Engineer

### Compensation

150-200k USD salary (in the US, other regions adjusted), 2% equity, and
[benefits](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook/blob/main/benefits.md).

### Location

We're globally all-remote. Team members so far are located in the US (GMT-8,
GMT-7 and GMT-6 so far). So far our communication has been semi-synchronous
with spontaneous video calls most days. Locations in GMT-14 to GMT+0 seem ideal.

### About the role

#### Skills

Dart, Flutter, and some amount of one of a systems language (e.g. C++, C, Rust)
OR cloud experience (e.g. AWS, GCP) desired. We work on many systems _around_
Flutter and Dart, but rarely write Flutter apps. We write the tools others will
use to build Flutter apps. Experience working on reused code (e.g. apis,
libraries, tools, build systems) will also serve you well.

#### How you add value

As one of our first engineers, you will wear many hats. You will work with a
diverse (and distributed) team of exceptional engineers (some who built Flutter
or key parts of the Flutter ecosystem initially) to build the future of
development for _any screen_ Most of our work will be _around_ Flutter, making
it easier for Flutter developers to deploy to the cloud, build and update
applications, etc.

You will be responsible for many of the "lowest" levels of the product, working
closely with Eric (CEO) to build the C++/C/Rust code that powers Shorebird. You
will also likely contribute to Dart's VM and compiler over time.

You will be responsible for many design decisions within the product, and will
be expected to be able to make tradeoffs between different approaches. You will
be expected to be able to work within a distributed team of engineers to build a
product that is easy to use, performant, secure and delightful to developers.
That starts of course by building something we ourselves want to use.

#### Must haves

- Interest/willingness to work on a small, distributed team
- Excited about Shorebird's mission of making high-quality multi-platform the default
- Passion around creating excellent developer experiences
- Experience building production software
- Familiarity with Compilers and/or Linkers
- Comfortable with Assembly, ideally ARM64
- Comfortable with C++, C and/or Rust
- Ability and desire to learn/teach yourself new skills as we go
- Ability to prioritize your own work among way too many options
- Excellent English spoken and written communication skills

### Interview Process

No, we don't ask you to do coding exercises. We're interested most in your past
projects/accomplishments (do you ship stuff?), your desire to work at a startup
and on this mission in particular, and your ability to communicate clearly.
We'll have a few conversations, possibly do a small project together and check
references. If it's a mutual fit, we'll make you an offer.

## Contractor: Compiler Engineer

Similar to the above, we're also interested / willing to consider contracting
an individual with strong Compiler and/or Linker experiance.

We're in the process of modifying the Dart VM to support our code push on
iOS, which includes modifying the AOT assembly generation, as well as teaching
an the Dart VM and its ARM simulator to execute in parallel with ARM64 code
on the real CPU, to allow replacing code at runtime without violating iOS
technical restrictions around JITing.

Eric worked on JavaScriptCore back in the day, and has built a few small VMs
but is not an expert in compilers. Our other engineers are also not compiler
experts. We're looking for someone who can help us acellerate our work to bring
code push to iOS.

## Reach out

If you're interested in joining us, either in a full-time or contracting
capacity, please email Eric. eric at shorebird.dev

You can also (and are encouraged to) hop on our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird) and chat with us there. We do pretty
much everything in the public so you can very much see what we're like without
even needing to apply.
