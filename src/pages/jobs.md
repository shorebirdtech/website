# Work at Shorebird

Shorebird is not actively hiring at this time.

## About Shorebird

The problem: Today, businesses write the same app at least twice at 2x the
necessary costs, with redundant code-bases, teams, bug lists. Flutter has proven
that high-quality multi-platform is possible. However, adopting Flutter can be
challenging since the default offerings from Google are sometimes an ill fit or
incomplete for non-Google teams. Shorebird is filling in the gaps businesses need
to be successful with Flutter development, starting with code push.

There are more screens every day, and they don't all run iOS (or even Android).
Yet consumers expect the a level of polish and performance on every screen that
the Web cannot deliver (Eric spent a decade trying). Flutter can, but
businesses need help to be successful with Flutter. That's where we come in.

We're here to save developers and business time and money, help them provide
their customers with better experiences, and hopefully make the world a better
place.

The primary unlock we made in building Flutter was bringing circa 2014 web tech
to mobile (reactive programming, hot reload, etc). Shorebird is repeating this
by bringing 2024 web tech to mobile (blurring client/server, always up-to-date
deploys, etc).

We're a default-public organization, we operate on a [public
discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird), our
[source](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/) and
[planning](https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects) are public. We're an
all remote, distributed team.

More information about the company we're trying to build can be found in our
[public handbook](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook)

# Founding Engineer

We write the tools others will use to build Flutter apps, including the compiler
used to build them and runtime used to execute them. Weâ€™re looking for someone
who enjoys working down at the "lower" levels of our system including the
forks of the Flutter and Dart runtime and compiler.

As one of our first engineers, you will wear many hats and work across many
systems over time. You will work with a diverse and distributed team of
exceptional engineers to build the future of development for _any screen_.
