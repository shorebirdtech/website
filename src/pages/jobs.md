### Developer Relations / Marketing Lead

Location: Remote (North America)

Type: Full-time or contract

Equity: Yes — Early-stage ownership opportunity

#### The problem

Shorebird is building “the Flutter company”. Our founder started/led Flutter,
and now we’re building a company to drive Flutter forward, even if Google
can’t/won’t. We’re starting by filling in the gaps in the Flutter ecosystem,
starting with Code Push (over the air updates). Our first product has been a
success, but only a small fraction of Flutter developers know what we do.

Your job is to help us reach _all_ Flutter developers. We’re so far 3 engineers
and an operations lead. None of us love marketing like you do. You will help us
craft our story and tell it widely. You love talking to developers, you love
writing content, giving talks etc and you’ll have full support to do what it
takes to raise awareness.

#### What You’ll Do

- Own marketing. From website content to email campaigns to positioning, you’ll
  shape how we tell the Shorebird story.

- Grow developer awareness. Craft and execute strategies to get Shorebird in
  front of every Flutter developer.

- Grow our social presence. Own and operate Shorebird’s social presence across
  all channels.

- Write and speak. Publish technical blog posts, create videos or live demos,
  speak at conferences, and engage with the community on X, GitHub, Reddit, and
  beyond.

- Advocate for Flutter and Shorebird. Shorebird only succeeds if Flutter does.
  You get to tell both stories to customers at all phases of their adoption
  journey.

- Build relationships. Identify and support influential Flutter developers and
  early adopters.

- Close the loop. Bring insights from the community back to the team to inform
  product direction.

#### What We’re Looking For

- Mission alignment. You care about helping the world stop writing everything
  twice. Flutter is our tool for that and Shorebird aims to take Flutter beyond
  where Google can.

- Strong desire to work at a startup. We’re a tiny team. All remote. You’ll be
  the first person fulltime driving awareness and will get to define our
  strategy and approach.

- Scrappy and self-driven. You are the marketing department. You are our DevRel
  org. You’ll have lots of help, but you’ll have to want to make your own
  decisions and own them. You’ll also (likely) be fully remote which means you
  need to be great at self motivation and self-direction.

- Experience working in Developer Relations, Product Marketing, or Technical
  Advocacy — or strong proof you can do the job.

- Strong writing and communication skills. You enjoy breaking down complex
  topics for different audiences.

- Comfort with code. You don’t need to be an expert Flutter dev, but you can
  read docs, run sample apps, and maybe write a working blog demo.

- Bonus: experience in startups, open-source communities, or the Flutter
  ecosystem.

#### Why Join

- Work directly with a small, senior team solving hard, high-impact problems.

- Influence product, messaging, and strategy from the ground up.

- Competitive compensation \+ early equity.

- Shape the future of how mobile apps are built and shipped.

### Full Stack Software Engineer

Location: Remote (North America) or in-person (Chicago, New York City, or Palo
Alto)

Type: Full-time

Equity: Yes — Early-stage ownership opportunity

#### The problem

We have one successful product with thousands of monthly users, delivering 10s
of millions of updates around the globe, every month. We built this all with 2
engineers. We also recently launched a second product. We simply need more
engineers to keep up with our growing user base an ambition.

#### What You’ll Do

- Build and maintain backend infrastructure (mostly in Dart) that powers
  developer tools used in production apps.

- Contribute to our open source command line tools and native C++ code.

- Own and ship features end-to-end, from our web UI to our backend APIs.

- Help shape our culture, processes, and product direction.

#### What We’re Looking For

- Mission alignment. You care about helping the world stop writing everything
  twice. Flutter is our tool for that and Shorebird aims to take Flutter beyond
  where Google can.

- Strong desire to work at a startup. We’re a tiny team. All remote. You’ll have
  to want to make your own decisions and own them.

- You're a strong generalist who can jump into unfamiliar systems and figure
  things out.

- You're a self-starter — you work well with little oversight and thrive in
  ambiguous environments.

- You’re excited about Flutter and want to help it succeed.

- You care about product quality and developer experience.

- You have solid experience with at least one part of the stack — cloud,
  developer tools, or compilers/runtimes — and are eager to learn the rest.

- Bonus: experience with build systems, deployment pipelines, or developer
  tools.

- Bonus: startup experience or contributions to open source projects.

#### Why Join

- Work directly with a small, senior team solving hard, high-impact problems.

- Competitive compensation + early equity.

- Shape the future of how mobile apps are built and shipped.
