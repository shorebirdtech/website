# Work at Shorebird

Shorebird is building "the Flutter company". Eric founded and led Flutter while
at Google, and now we are building a company to take Flutter beyond
where Google can. We're on a mission to help the world "stop writing everything
twice".

We need smart, hard-working people who want to work on start-up problems. We
have thousands of monthly active users, and more to do than our current team can keep
up with. No two days will be the same. You need to be strongly autonomous and
self-directing.

Our engineering work is _building_ Flutter, but don't really
get to use it much. Shorebird engineers should have some familiarity with Dart
and Flutter, but mostly we need people who want to talk to customers
and then build things to solve their problems (whether by writing code, docs, or
whatever).

We hang out with our customers all day, every day, on Discord. Most of our
stack is written in Dart, but we also have bits of TypeScript, Rust and C++ thrown in.
Most of our code is open source. We run a small cloud, serving 200+ requests per
second across several providers to millions of users around the globe.

We raised a seed round from great investors and have hundreds of paying
customers, $10k+ monthly revenue and 2+ years of runway. We're happy to put you
in touch with any references you should you wish.

In short, this is an awesome team and we'd like you on it.

## About Shorebird

The problem: Today, businesses write the same app at least twice at 2x the
necessary costs, with redundant code-bases, teams, bug lists. Flutter has proven
that high-quality multi-platform is possible. However, adopting Flutter can be
challenging since the default offerings from Google are sometimes an ill fit or
incomplete for non-Google teams. Shorebird is filling in the gaps businesses need
to be successful with Flutter development, starting with code push.

There are more screens every day, and they don't all run iOS (or even Android).
Yet consumers expect the a level of polish and performance on every screen that
the Web cannot deliver (Eric spent a decade trying). Flutter can, but
businesses need help to be successful with Flutter. That's where we come in.

We're here to save developers and business time and money, help them provide
their customers with better experiences, and hopefully make the world a better
place.

The primary unlock we made in building Flutter was bringing circa 2014 web tech
to mobile (reactive programming, hot reload, etc). Shorebird is repeating this
by bringing 2024 web tech to mobile (blurring client/server, always up-to-date
deploys, etc).

We're a default-public organization, we operate on a [public
discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird), our
[source](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/) and
[planning](https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects) are public. We're an
all remote, distributed team.

More information about the company we're trying to build can be found in our
[public handbook](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook)

# Systems Engineer

We write the tools others will use to build Flutter apps, including the compiler
used to build them and runtime used to execute them. The ideal candidate is
comfortable in the "lower" levels of our stack, including C++ programming on
mobile.

As one of our first engineers, you will wear many hats and work across many
systems over time. You will work with a diverse and distributed team of
exceptional engineers to build the future of development for _any screen_.

## Responsibilities

You will be responsible for many of the "lowest levels” of the product, working
on the C++/C/Rust code that powers Dart VM and compiler, Flutter’s engine and
Shorebird’s updater. This will include working on performance at these layers
and working with the rest of the team to maintain our forks of millions of lines
of C++ code.

You will be responsible for many design decisions within the product, and will
be expected to be able to make tradeoffs between different approaches. You will
be expected to be able to work within a distributed team of engineers to build a
product that is easy to use, performant, secure and delightful to developers.
That starts of course by building something we ourselves want to use.

## Location

We're fully remote. Current team members are located in California, Illinois, and
New York (GMT-8 through GMT-5). We are happy to consider anyone in GMT-10 through GMT-3. We
communicate exclusively through Discord (both in public and private), including
often leaving video calls open in the background while we work independently.

We get together 3-4x per year as a company, all flying to some US city.

## Compensation

180-210k USD salary, 1.5% equity, and
[benefits](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/benefits/).

## Requirements

- Wants to work at a startup
- Autonomous, able to work well independently, remotely and without supervision
- Excellent English spoken and written communication skills
- Some experience (ideally open source) with C++, C, or Rust
- Located in GMT-10 through GMT-3
- Ability and desire to learn/teach yourself new skills as we go
- Interest/willingness to work on a small, distributed team
- Excited about our mission of making high-quality multi-platform the default
- Likes creating excellent developer experiences
- Experience building and shipping production software

## Nice to haves

- Familiarity with Compilers and/or Linkers
- Familiarity with Assembly, ideally ARM64

Experience working on reused code (e.g. APIs, libraries, tools, build systems)
or in systems which are too large for any single person to understand would
serve you well in this role.

## Interview Process

We're most interested in your past projects/accomplishments (do you ship
stuff?), your desire to work at a startup (on this mission in particular), and
your ability to communicate clearly. We will do a technical screen, which
involves writing code together (e.g. write a small Dart command line app to do
X). You'll talk to all 3 of us and check mutual references. If it's a mutual
fit, we'll make you an offer.

## Reach out

If you're interested in joining us, please email eric@shorebird.dev. You can
also (and are encouraged to) hop on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird)
and chat with us there. We do pretty much everything in the public so you can
very much see what we're like without even needing to apply.

# Go-To-Market Lead

Shorebird currently consists of 3 software engineers. We're great at what we
do, but we have little "business experience". The most pressing issues facing
the company are no longer "can we build it", but "how do we build a company
around this". We're learning on the job, but are also looking for someone with
experience and desire to work on the many non-technical aspects of the business
with Eric (CEO). We're looking for someone to join us and help us better reach
and serve an influx of customers in capacities other than writing software.

## Location

We're all-remote, current team members are located in California, Illinois and
New York (GMT-8 through GMT-5). Will consider GMT-10 through GMT-3. We
communicate exclusively through Discord (both in public and private) including
often leaving video calls open in the background while we work independently.

We get together 3-4x per year as a company, all flying to some US city.

## Compensation

Listing a salary range for compliance, we will calibrate compensation to the
individuals applying. We target 75% of market with our base pay. I see this as a
career/senior (3-5 years experience) role, involving involving nearly unbounded
growth potential. This will be salary/equity compensated, not commission. Our
incentives should be aligned to build/grow the business over a long time
horizon.

130-175k USD salary, 1.5% equity, and
[benefits](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/benefits/).

## Requirements

- Wants to work at a startup
- Autonomous, able to work well independently, remotely and without supervision
- Excellent English spoken and written communication skills
- Experience with product, design, sales OR go-to-market roles
- Located in GMT-10 through GMT-3
- Ability and desire to learn/teach yourself new skills as we go
- Interest/willingness to work on a small, distributed team
- Excited about our mission of making high-quality multi-platform the default
- Interest/experience working with developer products

## Nice to haves

- Marketing, particularly content writing experience
- UX design experience
- Community management experience

This is a very broad role description, since we have so many different things
to do! You're not expected to do everything, but you will have nearly unbounded
opportunity to be engaged in the business. We'll work together to figure out
what the business needs most, figure out who's going to do it, figure out
how to do it (most things I do I've never done before) and then execute.

## Interview Process

We're most interested in your past projects/accomplishments (do you ship
stuff?), your desire to work at a startup (on this mission in particular), and
your ability to communicate clearly. Since I am not a "business" expert, you
will probably also meet with one of our investors or other other startup
founders as well as our team. The process can be very quick. If it's a mutual
fit, we'll make you an offer.
