# Work at Shorebird

Shorebird is not hiring at this time. However, we will likely be hiring
again later in 2023. The easiest way to engage with what we're doing is to
join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird) and chat with us there.

## About Shorebird

The problem: Today, businesses write the same app at least twice at 2x the
necessary costs, with redundant code-bases, teams, bug lists. Flutter has proven
that high-quality multi-platform is possible. However, adopting Flutter can be
challenging since the default offerings from Google are sometimes an ill fit or
incomplete for non-Google teams. Shorebird is filling in the gaps business need
to be successful with Flutter development, starting with code push.

We're here to save developers and business time and money, help them provide
their customers with better experiences, and hopefully make the world a better
place.

The primary unlock we made in building Flutter was bringing circa 2014 web tech
to mobile (reactive programming, hot reload, etc). Shorebird is repeating this
by bringing 2023 web tech to mobile (blurring client/server, always up-to-date
deploys, etc).

We're a default-public organization, we operate on a [public
discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird), our
[source](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/) and
[planning](https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects) are public. We're an
all remote, distributed team.

More information about the company we're trying to build can be found in our
[public handbook](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook)

### Location

We're globally all-remote. Team members so far are located in the US (GMT-8,
GMT-7 and GMT-6 so far). So far our communication has been semi-synchronous
with spontaneous video calls most days. Locations in GMT-14 to GMT+0 seem ideal.

### Interview Process

No, we don't ask you to do coding exercises. We're interested most in your past
projects/accomplishments (do you ship stuff?), your desire to work at a startup
and on this mission in particular, and your ability to communicate clearly.
We'll have a few conversations, possibly do a small project together and check
references. If it's a mutual fit, we'll make you an offer.
