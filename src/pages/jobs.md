# About Shorebird

Shorebird is a small, venture-funded startup (est Jan 2023) trying to make
Flutter the default way to write apps. So far we've built and shipped Code Push
for Flutter to let businesses over the air update their apps instantly on users
phones.

## Why work at a startup?

Having worked at both large and small companies, I can tell you, startups feel
very different from big companies and big teams.

Working at a startup means:

- Shipping. We ship 5 times a day, not 5 times a year.
- (Growth)[https://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html]. We are trying to
  grow quickly (revenues, customers, products, people, etc). Growth means
  opportunity, variety and challenge.
- Ambition. Hard work is needed and rewarded. Your colleagues are highly
  engaged, want to be here, want to work hard, and want to learn with and from
  you.
- Big upside. We pay well relative to other startups, but less (cash) than Big
  Tech. Instead we offer lots of equity. Equity means you own a percentage of
  Shorebird, and have a significant financial stake in the company's success.
- Ownership. The team is very small. For anything to be done, that means one of
  us is doing it. If you're going to do, you get to decide. Want to be our CDN
  expert or marketing expert or Dart compiler ninja? More than you could ever
  want to own, you will.
- No layers. Direct access to customers. Direct access to management (the CEO
  is the only manager). Nothing between you and direct action.
- Few distractions. Engineers don't have meetings. There are no perf reviews. We
  show up and do.

## Problem: App Development is Broken

App development is broken. The default answer to "write an app" is write it once
for iOS, once for Android, and once for the web (possibly more places).
Businesses write the same app at least twice at 2x the necessary costs, with
redundant code-bases, teams, bug lists.

This is bonkers. Not only is bad for businesses (lots of waste) and developers
(headaches in re-implementation and coordination), but also users (why can't my
friend install your app because their phone has a different brand or why does it
run so much better/worse than my copy of the app?). We're wasting countless
years of human life on this problem, for bad reasons.

I (and many others) tried to make the Web (PWAs, etc) solve "write once; run
anywhere" a decade ago and failed. Hence we built Flutter to let Google and
everyone write high-quality app experiences and have them go everywhere.

Flutter is now the most popular solution for writing multi-platform apps. Over
a million developers use Flutter every month, and growing. Flutter has proven
that high-quality multi-platform is possible.

However, still most apps don't use Flutter. And even some that do, sometimes
struggle. Adopting Flutter can be challenging since the default offerings from
Google are sometimes an ill fit or incomplete for those operating outside
Google.

The Flutter project itself is also sometimes a funny fit inside Google (the home
of Android, Ads and Chrome) and long term would benefit from an economic entity
wholly aligned with Flutter's goals (not just trying to use it to sell Ads or
Cloud).

All these problems are why, after taking Flutter as far as I could within
Google, I left to build a company around Flutter: Shorebird.

## Solution: The Flutter Company

Shorebird is filling in the gaps businesses need to be successful with Flutter
development. Just like how businesses "buy" Linux with Redhat, most businesses
will chose to buy Flutter solutions from Shorebird rather than cobbling together
Flutter solutions themselves. That means we'll offer a suite of products to
ensure you have a GREAT experience delivering apps to your users. The first
problem we've solved is code push.

Aspiring to be "the Flutter company" means building an economic entity whose
success is tied to Flutter, to finally help the world stop writing everything
twice.

Google has been great to Flutter, but Flutter within Google is bound by Google's
own incentives, which don't always align with that of Flutter's millions of
customers outside of Google. We're trying to build a company whose success is
aligned with the success of the businesses and developers using Flutter. A
company trusted to provide high quality services around Flutter, and eventually
fund the development of Flutter itself, if necessary.

If we're successful, Shorebird will eventually be synonymous with Flutter. We
hope to support every one of the millions of Flutter developers and the
businesses behind them.

## Where we're at

Shorebird incorporated January 2023. We've shipped our first product (code
push) and now support around 2000 monthly active users, with about 300 paying
customers and strong growth. We raised several million dollars from a top-5 VC
and great investors who care about our mission. We're not profitable yet, but
have two years of cash on hand.

We're only 3 people right now. All of us have engineering backgrounds. As our
customers have grown, so has our engineering load and we're seeking to hire
another full-stack engineer to help us scale to even larger customers. We're
also seeking to hire a "business person" to work with Eric to build out all the
non-software parts of the business.

In comparison to two years ago, we've dramatically de-risked the product and
market -- we have a working thing, that people want to buy. But there is still
much to do, so many choices to make, and so much to grow. That's where you come
in.

## What we do every day

Recently we've focused on growing monthly active users. During our latest
in-person summit in NYC, we did planning for next big features and products and
now that we're back to our respective cities, we're burning through that list
while supporting incoming customers.

We see about 40 new accounts sign up per day, about 3 of those become "active"
(create a release/patch every month) and 1 of those buys a plan. We also get a
couple of inbound SMB/enterprise sales calls per week through which Eric is
learning enterprise sales.

The first hour or so every morning is spent working through the support queue
which often results in small changes to the website, docs or code to avoid
future customers hitting the same issues. The rest of the day is spent
building. We have no meetings, no calendars, no perf reviews.

Most of the time we hang out on Discord video calls, but sometimes someone drops
off to jam out to their music, get coffee or lunch, etc. We use the same
Discord for private company chats and calls, private large-customer support
channels, and our public community, which makes it very easy to talk to
customers anytime we want to.

Engineers work across the whole stack. Our websites are in React (Astro), our
backend and command-line tool are in Dart, our Database is postgres. We use
Google Cloud, Redis and Cloudflare. We have our own fork of the Dart runtime
and compiler (C++) and Flutter engine (C++) as well as an updater library (Rust)
and a small Flutter package. Some of us prefer certain layers to others, but
ideally you should want to work on most of the above and more as you help us add
more products!

3-4 times a year we all get together in person for a week. We occasionally
attend meetups or fly to visit customers. Engineers aren't expected to attend
any meetings, Eric has several customer meetings a week (and sometimes per day).

## Learn more

We're a default-public organization, we operate on a [public
discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird), our
[source](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/) and
[planning](https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects) are public. We're an
all remote, distributed team.

More information about the company we're trying to build can be found in our
[public handbook](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook)

## Location

We're fully remote. Current team members are located in California, Illinois,
and New York (GMT-8 through GMT-5).

Our hiring is currently focused in the US, but we hope to expand globally over
time. We are willing to consider candidates in GMT-10 through GMT-3. We
communicate exclusively through Discord (both in public and private), including
often leaving video calls open in the background while we work independently.

We get together 3-4x per year as a company, all flying to some US city for a
week.

## Reach out

If you're interested in joining us, please email eric@shorebird.dev. You can
also (and are encouraged to) hop on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird)
and chat with us there. We do pretty much everything in the public so you can
very much see what we're like without even needing to apply.

# Founding Engineer

We write the tools others will use to build Flutter apps, including the compiler
used to build them and runtime used to execute them. The ideal candidate
should have at least passing familiarity with the "lower" levels of our stack
including using a systems-language (like C++) doing programming on mobile.

## Compensation

180-220k USD salary, 1.5% equity, and
[benefits](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/benefits/).

## About You

As one of our first engineers, you will wear many hats and work across many
systems over time.

You

- Want to work at a startup
- Work well independently, remotely and without supervision
- Speak and write excellent English
- Have some experience (ideally open source) with C++, C, or Rust
- Live within in GMT-10 to GMT-3 (US timezones +/- 2)
- Enjoy regularly learning/teaching yourself new skills
- Want to work on a small, distributed team
- Feel excited about our mission of making high-quality multi-platform the default
- Like creating excellent developer experiences
- Have experience building and shipping production software

You will

- make (many) design decisions within the product including tradeoffs between
  different approaches
- work with us to build a product that is easy to use, performant, secure and
  delightful to developers
- build something we all ourselves want to use

## Nice to haves

- Familiarity with Compilers and/or Linkers
- Familiarity with Assembly, ideally ARM64

Experience working on reused code (e.g. APIs, libraries, tools, build systems)
or in systems which are too large for any single person to understand would
serve you well in this role.

## Interview Process

We're most interested in your past projects/accomplishments (do you ship
stuff?), your desire to work at a startup (on this mission in particular), and
your ability to communicate clearly. We will do a technical screen, which
involves writing code together (e.g. write a small Dart command line app to do
X). You'll talk to all 3 of us and check mutual references. If it's a mutual
fit, we'll make you an offer.

# Founding "Business Person"

Shorebird is currently 3 software engineers. We're great at what we do, but we
have little "business experience". The most pressing issues facing Shorebird
are no longer "can we build it", but "can we build a business around this",
which involves "can we market, package, sell in a way that the market
understands."

We've done alright so far. Shorebird has had over 20k sign-ups in the last year,
resulting in ~2000 monthly active users and over 300 paying customers.  Revenues
have been growing over 10% month over month for the last year, but could grow
much faster with your help.

The biggest bottleneck for Shorebird that we do not have anyone consistently
moving the non-code parts of the company forward every day.  I (Eric, Founder)
try, but I have a lot of responsibilities to track. I need someone to brainstorm
with me on what would be our most impactful non-coding work, divide it up with
me, and then go run!

### What I'm looking for

I need someone who wants to work at a small startup, is comfortable working
across many areas, and while able to talk to developers and care about
developers & Flutter-using-businesses as customers, does not want to focus on
writing code as their day-job.

Individuals with a variety of backgrounds and ambitions could be successful in
this role. There are more things to do than you will want to do. That's fine.
The rest falls to me. Over time we'll hire more specialists and divide the
responsibility space, but to start it's just you and I making the biggest
impacts where we can.

This is an fantastic opportunity for someone eager and ambitious: we have
thousands of customers, lots of inbound interest, a working product and great
team. You'll move the business tremendously just by picking the low hanging
fruit.

### Where we are (financially)

Shorebird raised a seed round (from a top-tier VC and fancy angel investors)
funding back in Jan 2023. We're currently 3, with plans to grow by 2 people in
early 2025. We have ~18 months of runway with that growth. I expect we'll raise
a Series A early 2026.

Shorebird currently makes ~200k AAR. Our goal is to at least 5x revenues in
2025 (+15% month) to ~1M ARR. We've seen consistent organic growth at ~10% per
month the last year (3.2x y/y) even though our product was “beta” and
Android-only until March 2024. 5x growth in 2025 seems very achievable, and you
will have a _huge_ impact on us doing that.

### What we'd do together

If you were to show up tomorrow, you'd talk to customers, skim through our
(extensive) customer support logs, and sales call notes. Then you and I would
brainstorm about what's most impactful to work on, divide it up and go do.

I expect you'll tell me we should focus on these 3 first:

- Product positioning
  - Are we articulating our best pitch to our customers? Do we even have our
    value props all written down? Which one is most impactful? Do our various
    resources all clearly articulate that pitch?
- Pricing/packaging
  - We have a ton of buying friction. I get lots of needless sales calls
    because of pricing confusion, lack of “Business”-targeted subscription plan
    (fixed monthly price, fancier support guarantees, annual billing, etc.).
    What should our pricing/packaging be?
- Communication
  - Do we look enough like a typical Saas to meet buyers where they are? Have
    we explained our value proposition? Have we done so for all the necessary
    constituencies? Are we providing our advocates enough information to make
    their internal sales? Are we easy for our customers to find?

#### Where we'll go

We're building a company to serve millions of developers and businesses all
over the world with a suite of Flutter-associated products. We will have plenty
to do over time.

Other things I expect we'll work on together:

- Debugging our sales motion
  - How can we better utilize our large inbound customer stream (currently 30+
    sign-ups a day)? How do we get better at procurement? How can we make our
    sales process repeatable? This is not a “sales” role, but at a startup this
    size, we're all involved in “selling” to some extent.
- Outreach/marketing/events strategy and implementation
  - Where should we be meeting our customers? How should we be marketing? Do we
    need an advocates/experts program? How do we empower our users to be
    advocates?
- Product Strategy
  - We're trying to build “the Flutter company” not just “the code push company”
    so as we run out of useful additions to our first product (code push), what
    should we build next? In a company this small, so I'm not looking for a
    “product owner” in the same way a big company would, but you'll still play a
    huge role in defining our strategy for our current and future products.
- Support strategy
  - How should we be handling support? How should we be charging for it? What
    tools should we use to scale?
- Responding to “Enterprise” interest
  - I've said “no” to a handful of very-large (e.g. Fortune 1000) customers, for
    which we've seemed too small to engage with yet. Maybe you've dealt with
    enterprise sales/deals before and have a sense as to how we can say “yes”
    without wasting our time with companies we're too little to serve?
- Many, many more areas that I'm not thinking of, but I suspect you see.

Regardless we will sit down together, figure out what's most impactful and start
there, and over time figure out what all needs doing to reach our 2025 goals and
beyond.

## Compensation

We target 75th percentile All-US/Small-Companies market with our base pay and
are able to offer very strong equity incentives.

This is at-minimum an early-career role (3+ years experience), involving
involving nearly unbounded growth potential. More experience applicants are
welcome, there is plenty to do and the role and compensation can flex to
accommodate a variety of experience levels.

This role will be salary/equity compensated, not commission. Our incentives
should be aligned to build/grow the business over a long time horizon.

170-220k USD salary, 1.5% equity, and
[benefits](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/benefits/).

## Expectations

- High drive and initiative, with a very “roll up your sleeves” mentality and
  work ethic
- Want to work at a startup
- Want to work on a small, distributed team (we currently work from Palo Alto,
  Brooklyn and Chicago, all remotely)
- Work well independently, remotely and without supervision
- Enjoy regularly learning/teaching yourself new skills
- Willing to travel at least 3x per year to all-company summits
- Enjoy variable/occasional travel to conferences and summits, presenting and
  networking
- Monitor and optimize our customer acquisition funnel
- Work closely with our CEO and our software engineers
- Identify, curate, and analyze our product and business metrics and KPIs
- Deliver a compelling narrative and sales pitch to technical and non-technical
  folks
- Drive our marketing strategy to identify new customers
- Comfortable working with our customers' software engineers, CTOs, and business
  professionals

## Requirements

- Speak and write excellent English
- Have experience in a product, design, developer relations, sales, go-to-market or similar
- Live/work within GMT-10 to GMT-3
- Feel excited about our mission of saving people time and making apps better
- Have experience with and interest in developer products

## Nice to haves

- Experience with the Flutter ecosystem
- Experience with the needs of professional app developers and teams
- Marketing experience, particularly content writing experience
- UX design experience
- Community management experience

You're not expected fill all our gaps (even everything listed above) but you
will have nearly unbounded opportunity to be engaged in the business. We'll work
together to figure out what the business needs most, figure out who's going to
do it, figure out how to do it (most things I do I've never done before) and
then execute.

You will be responsible for as much of the "business side" of Shorebird as you
want. There is simply too much for Eric to do alone. You will be _building_
out our business capabilities (not managing existing processes), including
figuring out how best to reach customers, writing content, debugging our funnel,
improving our website, deciding marketing/events/communications strategy, etc.
I expect someone successful in this role to have a lot of opinions and we will
figure out what to do and learn together how to grow Shorebird's business.

## Interview Process

We're most interested in your past projects/accomplishments (do you ship
stuff?), your desire to work at a startup (on this mission in particular), and
your ability to communicate clearly. Since I am not a "business" expert, you
will probably also meet with one of our investors or other other startup
founders as well as our team. The process can be very quick (days, not weeks).
If it's a mutual fit, we'll make you an offer.
