# Work at Shorebird

## About Shorebird

The problem: Today, businesses write the same app at least twice at 2x the
necessary costs, with redundant code-bases, teams, bug lists. Flutter has proven
that high-quality multi-platform is possible. However, adopting Flutter can be
challenging since the default offerings from Google are sometimes an ill fit or
incomplete for non-Google teams. Shorebird is filling in the gaps business need
to be successful with Flutter development, starting with code push.

We're here to save developers and business time and money, help them provide
their customers with better experiences, and hopefully make the world a better
place.

The primary unlock we made in building Flutter was bringing circa 2014 web tech
to mobile (reactive programming, hot reload, etc). Shorebird is repeating this
by bringing 2024 web tech to mobile (blurring client/server, always up-to-date
deploys, etc).

We're a default-public organization, we operate on a [public
discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird), our
[source](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/) and
[planning](https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects) are public. We're an
all remote, distributed team.

More information about the company we're trying to build can be found in our
[public handbook](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook)

# Founding Systems Engineer

## Compensation

150-200k USD salary, 2% equity, and
[benefits](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook/blob/main/benefits.md).

## Location

We're all-remote, current team members are located in the US (GMT-8 through
GMT-5). Will consider GMT-10 through GMT-3. We communicate exclusively through
Discord (both in public and private) including often leaving video calls open in
the background while we work independently.

## About the role

We write the tools others will use to build Flutter apps, including the compiler
used to build them and runtime used to execute them. We’re looking for another
member who enjoys working down at the “systems” level with our Flutter runtime
and Dart compiler.

As one of our first engineers, you will wear many hats and work across many
systems. You will work with a diverse (and distributed) team of exceptional
engineers (some who built Flutter or key parts of the Flutter ecosystem
initially) to build the future of development for _any screen_.

## Skills

Proficiency in at least one systems language (e.g. C++, C, Rust). Experience
working on reused code (e.g. apis, libraries, tools, build systems) or in
systems which are too large for any single person to understand would serve you
well in this role.

## How you add value

You will be responsible for many of the "lowest levels” of the product, working
on the C++/C/Rust code that powers Dart VM and compiler, Flutter’s engine and
Shorebird’s updater. This will include working on performance at these layers
and working with the rest of the team to maintain our forks of millions of lines
of C++ code.

You will be responsible for many design decisions within the product, and will
be expected to be able to make tradeoffs between different approaches. You will
be expected to be able to work within a distributed team of engineers to build a
product that is easy to use, performant, secure and delightful to developers.
That starts of course by building something we ourselves want to use.

## Must haves
- Ability to work well independently and without direct supervision.
- Interest/willingness to work on a small, distributed team
- Excited about Shorebird's mission of making high-quality multi-platform the default
- Passion around creating excellent developer experiences
- Experience building production software
- Familiarity with Compilers and/or Linkers
- Comfortable with Assembly, ideally ARM64
- Comfortable with C++, C and/or Rust
- Ability and desire to learn/teach yourself new skills as we go
- Ability to prioritize your own work among way too many options
- Excellent English spoken and written communication skills

## Interview Process

No, we don't ask you to do coding exercises. We're interested most in your past
projects/accomplishments (do you ship stuff?), your desire to work at a startup
and on this mission in particular, and your ability to communicate clearly.
We'll have a few conversations, possibly do a small project together and check
references. If it's a mutual fit, we'll make you an offer.

## Reach out

If you're interested in joining us, either in a full-time or contracting
capacity, please email eric@. You can also (and are encouraged to) hop on our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird) and chat with us there. We do pretty
much everything in the public so you can very much see what we're like without
even needing to apply.
