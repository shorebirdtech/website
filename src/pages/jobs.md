# About Shorebird

## Why work at Shorebird?

You want to work at a startup. You want every day to be a bit different, full of
tons of things to learn and do. You want to work on making the world a little
better through Flutter.

You agree that app development is broken. You think the world would be better if
developers wrote for users, not platforms, and thus that the code they write
could work great on any screen it was needed on. Flutter might be the solution
that finally makes multi-platform the default, and you're interested in working
with us to make that happen.

You're excited to work with smart people who also are in on this mission, who
want to collaborate with you and teach you things and learn from you.

You want to work at a place that treats you fairly. We work hard, but not crazy
hours. We all have lots of responsibility (there are only 3 of us). We pay
market wages, with good benefits and great equity.

You like working remotely. You know how to self-direct and set yourself up to
succeed and community with others, even over distances. You like working on
open source, where we get to hang out with our customers all-day, everyday on
Discord.

## Where we're at.

Shorebird incorporated January 2023. We've shipped our first product (code
push) and now support around 2000 monthly active users, with about 300 paying
customers and strong growth. We raised several million dollars from a top-5 VC
and great investors who care about our mission. We're not profitable yet, but
have two years of cash on hand.

We're only 3 people right now. All of us have engineering backgrounds. As our
customers have grown, so has our engineering load and we're seeking to hire
another full-stack engineer to help us scale to even larger customers. We're
also seeking to hire a "business person" to work with Eric to build out all the
non-software parts of the business.

## What we do every day.

Recently we've focused on growing monthly active users. During our latest
in-person summit in NYC, we did planning for next
big features and products and now that we're back to our respective cities,
we're burning through that list while supporting incoming customers.

We see about 40 new accounts sign up per day, about 3 of those become "active"
(create a release/patch every month) and 1 of those buys a plan. We also get a
couple of inbound SMB/enterprise sales calls per week through which Eric is
learning enterprise sales.

The first hour or so every morning is spent working through the support queue
which often results in small changes to the website, docs or code to avoid
future customers hitting the same issues. The rest of the day is spent
building. We have no meetings, no calendars, no perf reviews.

Most of the time we hang out on Discord video calls, but sometimes someone drops
off to jam out to their music, get coffee or lunch, etc. We use the same
Discord for private company chats and calls, private large-customer support
channels, and our public community, which makes it very easy to talk to
customers anytime we want to.

Engineers work across the whole stack. Our websites are in React (Apollo), our
backend and command-line tool are in Dart, our Database is postgres. We use
Google Cloud, Redis and Cloudflare. We have our own fork of the Dart runtime
and compiler (C++) and Flutter engine (C++) as well as an updater library (Rust)
and a small Flutter package. Some of us prefer certain layers to others, but
ideally you should want to work on most of the above and more as you help us add
more products!

3-4 times a year we all get together in person for a week. We occasionally
attend meetups or fly to visit customers. Engineers aren't expected to attend
any meetings, Eric has several customer meetings a week (and sometimes per day).

## The problem

Today, businesses write the same app at least twice at 2x the necessary costs,
with redundant code-bases, teams, bug lists. Flutter has proven that
high-quality multi-platform is possible. However, adopting Flutter can be
challenging since the default offerings from Google are sometimes an ill fit or
incomplete for non-Google teams. Shorebird is filling in the gaps businesses
need to be successful with Flutter development, starting with code push.

## The Flutter Company

We aspire to be "the Flutter company". That means building an economic entity
whose success is tied to Flutter, to finally help the world stop writing
everything twice.

Google has been great to Flutter, but Flutter within Google is bound by Google's
own incentives, which don't always align with that of Flutter's millions of
customers outside of Google. We're trying to build a company whose success is
aligned with the success of the businesses and developers using Flutter. A
company trusted to provide high quality services around Flutter, and eventually
fund the development of Flutter itself, if ever necessary.

If we're successful, Shorebird will eventually be synonymous with Flutter. We
hope to support every one of the millions of Flutter developers and the
businesses behind them.

## Learn more

We're a default-public organization, we operate on a [public
discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird), our
[source](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/) and
[planning](https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects) are public. We're an
all remote, distributed team.

More information about the company we're trying to build can be found in our
[public handbook](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook)

## Location

We're fully remote. Current team members are located in California, Illinois, and
New York (GMT-8 through GMT-5). We are happy to consider anyone in GMT-10 through GMT-3. We
communicate exclusively through Discord (both in public and private), including
often leaving video calls open in the background while we work independently.

We get together 3-4x per year as a company, all flying to some US city.

## Reach out

If you're interested in joining us, please email eric@shorebird.dev. You can
also (and are encouraged to) hop on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird)
and chat with us there. We do pretty much everything in the public so you can
very much see what we're like without even needing to apply.

# Founding Full Stack Engineer

We write the tools others will use to build Flutter apps, including the compiler
used to build them and runtime used to execute them. The ideal candidate
should have at least passing familiarity with the "lower" levels of our stack
including using a systems-language (like C++) doing programming on mobile.

## Compensation

180-210k USD salary, 1.5% equity, and
[benefits](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/benefits/).

## About You

As one of our first engineers, you will wear many hats and work across many
systems over time.

You

- Want to work at a startup
- Work well independently, remotely and without supervision
- Speak and write excellent English
- Have some experience (ideally open source) with C++, C, or Rust
- Live within in GMT-10 to GMT-3 (US timezones +/- 2)
- Enjoy regularly learning/teaching yourself new skills
- Want to work on a small, distributed team
- Feel excited about our mission of making high-quality multi-platform the default
- Like creating excellent developer experiences
- Have experience building and shipping production software

You will

- make (many) design decisions within the product including tradeoffs between
  different approaches
- work with us to build a product that is easy to use, performant, secure and
  delightful to developers
- build something we all ourselves want to use

## Nice to haves

- Familiarity with Compilers and/or Linkers
- Familiarity with Assembly, ideally ARM64

Experience working on reused code (e.g. APIs, libraries, tools, build systems)
or in systems which are too large for any single person to understand would
serve you well in this role.

## Interview Process

We're most interested in your past projects/accomplishments (do you ship
stuff?), your desire to work at a startup (on this mission in particular), and
your ability to communicate clearly. We will do a technical screen, which
involves writing code together (e.g. write a small Dart command line app to do
X). You'll talk to all 3 of us and check mutual references. If it's a mutual
fit, we'll make you an offer.

# Go-To-Market Lead

Shorebird currently consists of 3 software engineers. We're great at what we do,
but we have little "business experience". The most pressing issues facing the
company are no longer "can we build it", but "can we build a business around
this", which is a lot of "can we market, package, sell in a way that the market
understands." We're learning on the job, but are also looking for someone with
experience and desire to work on the many non-technical aspects of the business
with Eric (CEO). We're looking for someone to join us and help us better reach
and serve an influx of customers in capacities other than writing software.

## Compensation

Listing a salary range for compliance, we will calibrate compensation to the
individuals applying. We target 75% of market with our base pay. I see this as a
career/senior (3-5 years experience) role, involving involving nearly unbounded
growth potential. This role will be salary/equity compensated, not commission.
Our incentives should be aligned to build/grow the business over a long time
horizon.

130-175k USD salary, 1.5% equity, and
[benefits](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/benefits/).

## Requirements

You

- Want to work at a startup
- Work well independently, remotely and without supervision
- Speak and write excellent English
- Have experience in a product, design, sales OR go-to-market role
- Live/work within GMT-10 to GMT-3
- Enjoy regularly learning/teaching yourself new skills
- Want to work on a small, distributed team
- Feel excited about our mission of saving people time and making apps better
- Have experience with and interest in developer products

## Nice to haves

- Marketing, particularly content writing experience
- UX design experience
- Community management experience

This is a very broad role description, since we have so many different things
to do! You're not expected to do everything, but you will have nearly unbounded
opportunity to be engaged in the business. We'll work together to figure out
what the business needs most, figure out who's going to do it, figure out
how to do it (most things I do I've never done before) and then execute.

You will be responsible for as much of the "business side" of Shorebird as you
want. There is simply too much for Eric to do alone. You will be _building_
out our business capabilities (not managing existing processes), including
figuring out how best to reach customers, writing content, debugging our funnel,
improving our website, deciding marketing/events/communications strategy, etc.
I expect someone successful in this role to have a lot of opinions and we will
figure out what to do and learn together how to grow Shorebird's business.

## Interview Process

We're most interested in your past projects/accomplishments (do you ship
stuff?), your desire to work at a startup (on this mission in particular), and
your ability to communicate clearly. Since I am not a "business" expert, you
will probably also meet with one of our investors or other other startup
founders as well as our team. The process can be very quick. If it's a mutual
fit, we'll make you an offer.
