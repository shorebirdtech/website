## 🐦 What is Shorebird?

Shorebird allows you to update your Flutter apps instantly over the air,
deploying fixes directly to end users' devices. Shorebird can be [integrated into
your app](https://docs.shorebird.dev) in under 5 minutes and requires no code changes. With Shorebird, you
can update any Dart code in your app instantly.

Shorebird is built to comply with
[Apple](https://docs.shorebird.dev/faq#does-shorebird-comply-with-app-store-guidelines)
and
[Google](https://docs.shorebird.dev/faq#does-shorebird-comply-with-play-store-guidelines)
store policies without sacrificing performance (even after patching).

Shorebird is free to use for small apps and offers plans that scale as your app
grows.
