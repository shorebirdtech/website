# Patch Signing (beta) üîí

Shorebird‚Äôs code push for Flutter allows developers to update their Flutter apps
instantly, over the air, deploying fixes directly to end users‚Äô devices. Our
solution takes less than 5 minutes to integrate and requires no code changes.
Shorebird‚Äôs code push can update any Dart code in your app. We‚Äôve designed our
system to comply with Apple and Google store policies without sacrificing
performance (even after patching).

One of our design goals has been that Shorebird should be the default for all
users of Flutter. To do that, using Shorebird needs to be a strict upgrade from
default Flutter and never worse than not using it. This includes ensuring that
Shorebird is always helping with the security and privacy of your application,
never the other way around.

Already, Shorebird has many systems in place to ensure the security of your
application. Today we‚Äôre adding one more: patch signing. Patch signing allows
you to cryptographically sign patches. Applications using patch signing will
mathematically verify the patch contents came from you before using them. This
means your application never has to trust any systems or networks along the way
since regardless of how the patch arrived to it, it can know it came from you or
not using the same signing technologies the app stores use for distribution.

This is all in addition to the many ways in which Shorebird already works to
protect the security of all our customers, including limiting what data ever
leaves your servers (we never see or store your source code), securing what data
we do store both via encryption in transit and in rest, cryptographically
hashing and validating the contents of any patch you create, as examples. You
can see a full break-down of security practices we follow on your behalf in our
[public security policies](https://handbook.shorebird.dev/security).

The patch signing we‚Äôve shipped today is marked as ‚Äúbeta‚Äù. The functionality is
all there, but we expect rough edges around how the system integrates with
existing continuous deployment and key storage. A system is only as secure as
its weakest link, so improving our integrations with your preferred key
management systems, etc. is where we go next.

We‚Äôre looking for companies to work with us in testing and improving patch
signing over the next few weeks. If you are interested, please give it a try:
https://docs.shorebird.dev/guides/patch-signing/ You can also reach out to us
via [GitHub](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/),
[Discord](https://discord.gg/shorebird) or [email](contact@shorebird.dev) should
you have feedback or questions.

We‚Äôd love to help you integrate Shorebird code push into your application.
Please reach out to us if you have any questions or need help getting started.
