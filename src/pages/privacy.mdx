  you if Shorebird is acquired by or merged with another company, in

- Legal purposes: We may disclose any of the information we collect to respond
  to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, law enforcement requests, legal

  situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,
  or violations of our Terms of Service).

disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or pursuant to your
